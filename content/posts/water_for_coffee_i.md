Inspired by this video from James Hoffman:

I wanted to optimize water for brewing my coffee.

However, as Hoffman notes, buying bottles of water optimized for coffee leads to plastic waste. Since I actively try to reduce waste (e.g. [buying used from eBay]({{< ref "used_on_ebay.md" >}})), I researched a "practical water setup" minimizing plastic waste: purifying water with a special filter jug, then remineralizing that purified water with [a precise recipe](https://www.baristahustle.com/diy-water-recipes-redux). I bought the special filter jug used from eBay.
