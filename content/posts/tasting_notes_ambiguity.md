In ["How to Talk About Wine Like a Japanese Tea Master"](https://dreaminginjapanese.substack.com/p/how-to-talk-about-wine-like-a-japanese), Ogasawara challenges:
> [A]re you sure that when you say “It tastes like a peach” that every peach tastes the same, or everyone else tastes a peach the same way you do? Peaches are tough enough to pin down, but what about _fuzzy figs_ and _gushing oranges, candied cherries or Asian pears_...

Instead of referring to [categories of notes as I've suggested before]({{< ref "tasting_notes_precision.md" >}}), Ogasawara finds a high-minded alternative, emphasis on _high_:
> A grand crus from the Côte de Beaune is the _Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele_ by Jan van Eyck.

> Or this Amarone della Valpolicella that I’ve been saving for Christmas is the _Madonna della Vittoria_ by Mantegna.

She quotes physicist Richard Feynman, emphasis on _high out of his mind_:

> The glass [of wine] is a distillation of the earth's rocks, and in its composition we see the secrets of the universe's age, and the evolution of stars.

Then she goes _off the rails_:

> You can choose whatever you like. My husband—the ever-competitive astrophysicist—suggested our wine tastings involve speaking in terms of stars and galaxies.

> Yes!

No! We're getting further from [usefulness]({{< ref "tasting_notes_usefulness.md" >}}), and [bending toward classism]({{< ref "tasting_notes_precision.md" >}})! I don't want to find the secrets of the universe in my [Target]({{< ref "threshold_of_my_bedroom.md" >}}) glass. And I definitely don't think of [Two Buck Chuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Shaw_wine) as the North Star nor the Andromeda Galaxy. Let's converse _over_ drinks, not _via_ drinks!

It reminds me of this excerpt from [_Death & Co: Modern Classic Cocktails_](https://archive.org/details/deathcomoderncla0000kapl/page/17/mode/1up?q=campfire), to which I'll respond to highlight the non-translation of high-minded tasting notes:
> Tasting spirits is about a connection to a personal experience, a way of articulating a memory or an association with what you smell of taste. A peaty Scotch might remind you of a campfire near the ocean, for example ...

My last camping trip we brought minimal supplies to live closer to nature or whatever. When it rained, we covered the campfire with a tarp and took turns in the "cancer shack" suffocating on smoke to keep the fire alive long enough to cook quite possibly my saddest meal, [I Can't Believe It's Not Rations!®](https://www.icantbelieveitsnotbutter.com)

So if your Scotch reminds you of a campfire near the ocean, _get bent_, I'll have a glass of extra ordinary Two Buck Chuck instead.
