I asked my friend, while they were playing their recently bought guitar. 
# For romantic others
My friend thought it romantic to serenade a partner with a ballad on the guitar. Many a sappy love song come originally or well arranged for an acoustic guitar.
# For platonic others
I jokingly asked if they wanted to annoy others at parties by playing guitar. Though in an intimate setting, two or three people, I like the idea of singing along together with a guitar. At the same time, I feel shy enough about singing that I don't know if I could muster the will.
# For current self
It feels fun to play a song you really like, and sing along. I don't think I need to go any deeper than that for you to understand.
# For ideal self
My friend and I agreed we enjoyed learning to play the guitar: to gradually improve the hit of the strings, the movement of the fingers, the progression of notes and chords. I imagine an ideal self, expert and experienced in a broad set of skills, interesting beyond pedant, nimble in body on top of mind. I often play guitar to that version of myself.
