Do I feel guilty about [praising French stuff]({{< ref chili_butter_french_butterfat >}}) like everyone else? Well, I'm writing a fifth post, so you bet I do.

In _How the World Really Works_, Vaclav Smil writes:

If we were to stake longevity (accompanied by healthy and active life) solely on the prevailing diet ... then Japanese eating has a slight edge, but an only slightly inferior outcome can be had by eating as they do in Valencia.

Screw you, Vaclav! How much you seem to know about global energy matches only how little you seem to know about good Japanese food, sitting in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada ([population < 0.3% Japanese](https://www.jcamwpg.ca/japanese-canadians-in-manitoba)).

[American cuisine assigns a "classy" premium to European cuisine.](https://www.barandrestaurant.com/food-beverage/why-american-fine-dining-still-so-eurocentric) However, I, [who does not hold authenticity dear]({{< ref chili_butter_against_authenticity >}}), will gladly mix Sichuanese chilies into the French butter as some small form of "fusion" cuisine.
