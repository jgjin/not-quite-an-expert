In the case of [private label]({{< ref "private_label.md" >}}), the buyer buys from the seller who has re-branded (i.e. re-packaged) goods supplied by an existing brand.

In an interesting reverse, I'll call it a "reverse private label", the buyer buys from the seller who supplies an existing brand. Note that in both cases, the buyer is trying to save by not paying for the existing brand.

I've done this a few times:
1. Buying from [Reigning Champ, under CYC Design Corporation which also supplied Supreme](https://www.grailed.com/drycleanonly/cyc-corp-reigning-champ-history)
2. Buying from [North Star Leather](https://www.nstarleather.com/optimizer/category/Belts.html), which [uses leather from S.B. Foot Tanning Company](https://www.nstarleather.com/optimizer/category/SBFootHeritageLeather.html), a [subsidiary and principal supplier of Red Wing Shoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._B._Foot_Tanning_Company) which [also supplied Carhartt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Wing_Shoes)
3. Buying from [Acme Smoked Fish, which also supplied Russ & Daughters](https://acmesmokedfish.com/blogs/news/the-house-that-lox-built)
