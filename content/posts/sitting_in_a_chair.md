I spent one elementary school summer at a Wayne State University youth camp building Lego robotics. Since both my parents worked full-time, the camp doubled as a daycare. After all the other kids got picked up, I would follow the counselor to some office to wait for my dad.

I didn't like sitting still in some boring, stuffy office. I fidgeted, shook, whatever children do outside the bounds of adult manners. 

One of the office employees did not enjoy this. She demanded I stay put on the chair. "This is a place of business!" She asserted.

In ploy for attention, a kick against boredom, or merely an outburst of childish whimsy, I sat in the chair. 

_In_, cross-legged on the floor surrounded by the legs of the chair.

"What are you doing?"

"I'm sitting _in_ the chair."

"Well don't, sit _on_ the chair."

"What do you mean? I'm sitting _in_ the chair."

"_On_. This is a place of business!"

I pouted, unable to argue prepositions, and pondered other ways to pass the time.

A few days later, I didn't see the office lady who demanded I sit _on_ the chair.

"Where is she?"

"She had to attend her mother's funeral." The counselor informed me. 

"Oh." My face contorted in a way it had not before. I didn't know how else to respond.

A few days after that, I saw her again. I didn't know what to say. As a bid for normalcy, I sat _in_ my chair, hoping for the same response. She responded differently, gentle, or rather, tired. I couldn't quite tell, and I certainly couldn't ask. Instead, I climbed up to sit _on_ the chair.
