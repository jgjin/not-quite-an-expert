When [the special filter jug]({{< ref "water_for_coffee_i.md" >}}) arrived, I noticed the packaging touted how pure the jug would filter water. I suspect this product would appeal most to those who glorify pure water. However, pure water doesn't mean better water.

Not only does [pure water taste "off" without minerals](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1ktxq3/does_pure_water_really_have_no_taste_or_are_we), purified water lacks beneficial additives like [fluoride, which reduces tooth decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fluoridation).

[I lean more scientific than woo-woo]({{< ref "woo_woo_warriors_and_bio_hackers.md" >}}), so I'm using the special filter jug for a specific alternative purpose: achieving a precise level of hardness and alkalinity specified by [this Barista Hustle recipe](https://www.baristahustle.com/diy-water-recipes-redux).
