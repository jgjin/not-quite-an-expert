# I
vacillate between festering and taking the opportunity to improve myself. Today, I woke up from a 3 hour nap at 9 PM,[^1] and did a full workout (a rarity before the Inside Times). 

I generally know what I should and shouldn't do for my well-being. Knowing has not made the difference; whether I can draw energy from my often mysterious well resolves the split. 

Recently, I have seen myself frequently in the eyes of others, more specifically in the limbo before the video call. Such impressions, negative or not, have driven my attempts to make more of the Inside Times.
[^1]: Excuse me, what?
# We
all occupy an extended stress state; even our surge capacity has dried up. This force dominates most of my free conversations; sometimes the system swallows up the near-entirety of individuals.
# You
are doing well, _considering_. However you cope, an absence of self-destruction means you are doing **_tremendously_**. And if you find yourself in harm, I sincerely hope you take the care you can muster.
