While on vacation, our family got a rideshare in a surprise Cybertruck!

My mom speculated "must be expensive", to which to driver replied "yeah, a little expensive". Then with some real big mom energy, my mom hit him with "well, maybe just a little expensive for you"! The driver tried to recover by spouting some financial justifications, though by then I had already relayed the conversation to my friends.

My mom commented on the driver's shyness afterward. Based on this anecdotal evidence, I'd read the buyer of a Cybertruck as trying to become less self-conscious;[^1] [the truck itself seems to perform worse than other trucks.](https://youtu.be/_S7GU9lDpq8?t=1181) So getting read as a passenger as trying to become less self-conscious made me very self-conscious. I spent the ride trying to focus inward rather than outward.
