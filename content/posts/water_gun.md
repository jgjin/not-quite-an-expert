# Introduction
You know water guns. I don't need to explain water guns. If you don't, re-read the name, a gun that shoots water.
# Safety
Children like shooting things. Shockingly, parents don't like their children getting shot. Therefore, parents buy their children water guns to play with. We normally distinguish a water gun by its safety.
# Danger
A few days ago, I read an article about a protester shooting a water gun at the Olympic torch. I found this incredibly interesting. Because in that moment, the water gun presented arguably more danger than a traditional gun. It really highlights how power and danger can arise contextually.
# Conclusion
Hopefully you found this as funny and provocative as I did.
