[A related story I've enjoyed](https://themoth.org/stories/a-holey-feast)

At any hotpot I look for one thing: quail eggs. Their small size yields a wonderful texture - inside the _al dente_ egg white, a generous core of silky egg yolk!

The last 2 times I got all-you-can-eat hotpot, I shocked and awed both groups of friends with my voracious quail egg consumption. By the time I lost count of my orders of quail eggs, the servers knew my every request would include quail eggs.

My family has a holiday hotpot every year. In past years, we'd have one can of quail eggs for me, and one can for everyone else. This year, we had an entire bowl of quail eggs, for me! With maybe a few left for everyone else.

Everyone else can have their fancy stuffed fish tofu, and sliced beef, and beef tendon. I'll be 美美地 eating through my precious pile of quail eggs.
