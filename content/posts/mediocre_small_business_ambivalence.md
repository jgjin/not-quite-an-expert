[While I characterized the first tea shop as woo-woo,]({{< ref "magical_space_corn.md" >}}) I'd characterize the second as "mediocre small business". 

The shop had more types of tea than the number I think a shop can do well, given my penchant for [hyperspecialization]({{< ref "hyperspecialization.md" >}}). When I asked to buy samples, the shopkeeper clarified that they sell minimum 2oz _each type_. I guessed that they wanted to force larger orders, and kept to myself that a larger tea purveyor would probably sell samples (at a premium per weight) to persuade new customers.

I bought a cup of "passionfruit" [tisane]({{< ref "tea.md" >}}) that did not have passionfruit nor taste like passionfruit ([I would know]({{< ref "passionate_for_passionfruit.md" >}})). I smelled the tea samples on the shelf (respectfully holding the jars at the bottom as instructed), which upset the shopkeeper because I was not going to buy any more tea today.

I do want to support small businesses. I do, e.g. I've bought from [Song Tea](https://songtea.com) for years (eventually convincing my office manager to buy some for the office). However, the experience left me with such a sour taste that I gave my unfinished cup to a rando on the street asking for food or drink.
