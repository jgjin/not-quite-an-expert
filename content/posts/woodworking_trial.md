I started woodworking a wall shelf! I've decided to record some lessons here.

I spent a good chunk of time theorizing about woodworking this shelf with my carpenter friend. However, at some point you have to actually try it out!

When I went to the public makerspace, the helpful member guided me to cut a scrap piece of wood (after I signed a waiver of liability of course!). I eyed the slight deviation of the cut from the marked line, and adjusted the line on my large, expensive piece of wood for the shelf. With that, I cut it exactly as intended.
