With online consumption, we have more choices than we can effectively individually evaluate. Recommendation algorithms can help. However, they reflect the oft-unknown biases and incentives of their creators, and often suffer homogeneity.

While you could just [satisfice]({{< ref "satisficing.md" >}}), my posts demonstrate that I don't just simply satisfice. [I use curators to navigate the vast space of online consumption.](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/the-new-generation-of-online-culture-curators)


I use curators so much, in fact, that I've curated curators:
1. specialized curators, like [Sleep Like The Dead](https://www.sleeplikethedead.com) for mattresses
2. rigorous general curators, like [Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter)
3. community-based curators, like [Reddit](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/what-google-search-isnt-showing-you)

I've felt more efficient satisficing via curated curators.
