I did it. I found another case of the passion fruit-flavored Spindrift. Rather, I found 2 cases of it.

I had schemed for passion fruit-flavored Spindrift. I had signed up for a free trial of a grocery delivery service to get it delivered from Flushing. When I found out they wouldn't deliver from Flushing, I offered a hefty 100% delivery fee to a friend stopping by Flushing.

[I ended up making my own passion fruit syrup.]({{< ref "passionate_for_passion_fruit" >}}) However, seeing 2 whole cases of passion fruit Spindrift in front of me provoked an impulse to _hoard._ Surely, no one would appreciate this passion fruit Spindrift as much as me!

Someone else would appreciate it, though, especially given how quickly they ran out of stock before. So I bought just 1 case for myself, and left the other for someone I do not know.
