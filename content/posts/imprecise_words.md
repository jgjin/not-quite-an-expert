no set of words, arranged in any order, can make you feel the exact way I do

not even "I," my past self, and "you," my future self

good words, however, will get you to understand

understand, not feel, the sensations and emotions

yet those good words may not do good

some sensations and emotions I do not want to understand

at least not yet
