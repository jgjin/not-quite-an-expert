They produce so much content that I often find exactly what I want without knowing I wanted it. For example:
1. [Michelle Zauner of Japanese Breakfast narrates _Monstrous Beauty: A Feminist Revision of Chinoiserie_](https://www.metmuseum.org/audio-guide/playlists/monstrous-beauty)
2. [Adrianne Lenker of Big Thief illustrates alternative guitar tunings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bAugdYu8LQ)
3. [Samin Nosrat of Salt Fat Acid Heat gossips about peaches](https://play.prx.org/listen?ge=prx_3492_c29779c0-3542-482e-9788-2a32d08668c8&uf=https%3A%2F%2Fpublicfeeds.net%2Ff%2F3492%2Ffeed-rss.xml)

As it gets easier to produce content, even generate content (via prompts), I worry that I'll get exactly what I want _and not much else_, missing out on content that would challenge me and expand my tastes.
