As I've been [AeroPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AeroPress)-ing coffee for my teammates in the office, I've found pouring between mugs awkward, with much spillage of good good coffee.

So one night, post-midnight (_la madrugada_), I over-thought through 5 iterations of coffee servers.

I started with Hario's glass coffee server. However, I'd be pressing into the glass, [which another person reported had shattered with their AeroPress](https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/w56kqn/comment/ij22qrs)

Then I considered "heavy-duty" use cases. However, looking into a borosilicate Pyrex beakers, I found [they would also shatter with the AeroPress](https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/11mmwa1/comment/jbirnkq).

Ok, so why not the carafe made for AeroPress by the same company? Recently, [AeroPress got bought out by private equity](https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/12r7jyu/thoughts_on_new_products_and_direction), and since then they've been putting out [unnecessary spinoffs](https://youtu.be/0Ds0pgSLT4I) like a brand being bled dry by private equity. I don't want a part in that, especially since these spinoffs seem untested relative to the original product.

Digging deeper, I found Hario _used_ to make a nice metal coffee server. I liked it because the metal wouldn't shatter under an AeroPress, and because I could extend it in the future to brew pour-over coffee with the Hario V60 drippers, [which have become an industry standard due to their accessibility](https://youtu.be/BfNoNTjcRbE), consistency, and high quality ceiling of output. However, [one detractor complained the hard-to-clean lid starts to smell over usage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/ibacm9/comment/g1uhr0k).

So digging even deeper, I found Hario also _used_ to make an upgraded version of their metal coffee server, with a disassemble-able lid! Finally, I bought one from [a small shop which still had the model in stock](https://ablebrewing.com/products/hario-v60-insulated-stainless-steel-server).
