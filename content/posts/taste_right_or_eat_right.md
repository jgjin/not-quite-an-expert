I didn't want to go to the ceviche restaurant that my mom suggested, because I wanted to have [good taste]({{< ref "restaurants_id_make.md" >}}), and it looked like a tourist trap. How does the restaurant have such a high average rating? Did they game reviews? And why does their online menu read like an advertisement?

However, tapas cost a lot for not that much food, so we go to the ceviche restaurant. Having eaten at [so many restaurants]({{< ref "momofuku.md" >}}), I can read a menu more deeply:
1. If we order the normal ceviche, it will come with this "white fish", similar in quality to [the non-specific "white wood" sold in bulk at hardware stores](https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3944/what-is-the-type-of-wood-that-is-often-purchased-in-bulk-at-the-hardware-store), tough and flavorless - or we could order the elevated ceviche with named seafood, like "scallops", and proper sauce
2. If we order the normal tiradito, it will come with tuna, the one less preferred in sushi, fishy and metallic - or we could order the elevated tiradito with salmon, the one more preferred in sushi, and [passion fruit]({{< ref "passionate_for_passion_fruit.md" >}})
3. If we order one of the "signature" dishes, it will resemble the anniversary/sugar baby restaurant from yesterday, flashy and bland - or we could order the [lomo saltado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lomo_saltado) hailing from Chinese Peruvian cuisine, with interesting yet familiar flavors

I'm paying for dinner regardless. So I could order the normal dishes, expose the restaurant, and prove my taste right. Or I could order the elevated dishes, expose myself, and guide us to eat right. While it pains me a little, I do the latter, because I prefer my parents eat right.
