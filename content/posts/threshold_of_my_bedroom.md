I want nice things - selfishly, to feel good; generously, to reduce waste. And it seems like Target's [private label]({{< ref "private_label.md" >}}) brand [Threshold](https://corporate.target.com/about/products-services/target-brands) consistently provides the right balance of quality and affordability for me. For example, [their sheets got recommended by Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-sheets), which [I've mentioned before as a good curation source]({{< ref "curating_curation.md" >}}).

So I got [the Threshold blackout curtains](https://www.target.com/p/-/-/A-82282449), and when they arrived, they felt so good. Enveloped in their softness, I rushed to my bedroom to put them up. And in the privacy of my bedroom, I stroked them gently, admiring the color and texture with a quiet sigh...

The next morning, I woke up with the sun shining through the curtains, and I knew it not to be. Since I needed full blackout curtains, I returned the beautiful blackout curtains to Target, my love, with a heavy heart.
