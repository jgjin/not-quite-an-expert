I don't recall dreaming about school _that_ often. However, this dream seemed separate from any recurring theme or motif.

In this dream, I was attending a _prestigious_ English course. To my surprise, the teacher announced a vocab quiz. For each word, we had to remember its "run time" as a grade. For example, the word "apocryphal" had a "run time" of C-- (remember dreams don't have to make sense).

I had not studied for the quiz, so I had no idea of the run times of the words. Did "zoological" have a run time of B+ or B (the answer, _of course_, A-)? Stuck shooting in the dark, I didn't even get to put down enough answers.

After the quiz, my classmate revealed the teacher was considering kicking out the lowest-performing student, probably me. I asked my classmate why they had taken the course. They responded, almost offended, that this _prestigious_ course would lead to _prestigious_ opportunities in the world of English literature. "You could get into X, or do Y, like famous person Z!"

Realizing I personally didn't care about the world of English literature, I marched up to the teacher and cussed them out. "If this course involves enduring such stupidity, suffering such nonsense, wading through such **BS**, I'll gladly dEmOTe myself to the regular English track."

And then I woke up. I can't tell you what happens after that; the [diegesis]({{< ref "diegesis.md" >}}) doesn't really matter. After recontextualizing myself into the waking world, I thought about all the BS I had dragged myself through because I thought I _should_.
