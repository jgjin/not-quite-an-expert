Everyone has principles of clothing, even if just "I want something cheap and comfortable enough (see [satisficing]({{< ref "satisficing.md" >}}))" or "I wear what I can".

Under my current principles:
1. I start with quality basics in neutral colors
2. I finish with final touches in loud colors and patterns
3. [I try not to spend more than an average person could splurge]({{< ref "hwyl_aesthetics.md" >}})

To fulfill the second principle, I've started renting "statement pieces" from a service touting ["[p]ersonal styling by experts and AI"](https://taelor.style). "AI" here signals [startup](https://dailynorthwestern.com/2021/06/24/campus/nu-lecturer-founded-startup-taelor-addresses-style-and-sustainability-with-artificial-intelligence).

[Clothing rental seems to have limited longevity as a business](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/rent-runway-stitch-fix-business-models-6db18bbd), so let's see how it shakes out.
