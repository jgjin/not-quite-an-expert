# Introduction
Today I shopped for a plain white t-shirt. My requirements:
1. plain
2. white
3. t-shirt

All in all, pretty simple. So how in the everloving world did I spend **2+ hours** buying plain white t-shirts?
# Buying online
Buying basically anything online represents a **hard** problem. 

First, you face a staggering amount of candidates. Search for lotions or cables or shirts and you'll find yourself trekking through an endless jungle of prices, styles, and brands. 

Second, you don't have complete information about the candidates. Will it work well? Will it last?

To solve these problems, we have user reviews and curators such as [Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/). However, reviews can suffer from undue bias (e.g. sponsored content) and may not align with your personal needs. If you believe the opinions illegitimate or irrelevant, then you'll have to fall back upon your instincts or (hopefully) return policy.
# Satisficing
When dealing with **hard** problems, with many possibilities and lack of information, people often get overwhelmed. When they don't get too overwhelmed to think, they employ [satisficing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing). Instead of looking for an optimal solution, they accept a good enough solution.

In our plain white t-shirt buying, this manifests in 2 ways:
1. Going to [a trusted source](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-white-t-shirts-for-men/) and buying the first shirt that makes sense
2. Imposing more restrictions, e.g. < $20, until one shirt emerges victorious
# Conclusion
In my case, I tried both, yet I still spent **2+ hours** shopping. Perhaps I need to get better at satisficing.
