Let's say you really want to smell the roses, like a concentrated BLAST of roses. Only a small portion of roses creates its smell, which you can extract into rose absolute.

You create rose absolute through a process known as solvent extraction. The solvent extracts the desired compounds, and after separating the solvent, you have the desired compounds.

To make solvent extraction more effective, we prefer a solvent that:
1. extracts more of the desired compounds
2. extracts less of the undesired compounds
3. separates easily from the desired compounds

For roses, I am using ethanol, in which the desired rose fragrance compounds easily dissolve,[^1] and which evaporates at an easily achieved temperature (above room temperature).
[^1]: I could not explain why compounds exhibit solubility in certain solvents, though.

I'll update with more once my ethanol arrives!
