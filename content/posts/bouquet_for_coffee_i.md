Upon visiting [Manjul Coffee & Clothing](https://www.instagram.com/manjulcoffee), I got inspired to enjoy coffee via presentation.

I found [the Kinto brand](https://kinto-usa.com/pages/about) of drinkware, part of the larger sphere of Japanese luxuries which includes matcha, [Uniqlo]({{< ref "uniqlo_x_jw_anderson.md" >}}), and fruity whisky. Kinto also makes flower vases, including [a few-stem vase](https://kinto-usa.com/collections/accents/products/20333) so I don't spend forever arranging stems like last time.

After buying the few-stem vase in NoLIta, I rode the subway, vase in hand, to Bushwick, where I found [a florist offering mini dried bouquets](https://stemsbrooklyn.com/product/the-mini-dried-bouquet). The florist and I admired the unique design of the vase, then worked together, considering color, structure, and texture, to make a micro dried bouquet of sea lavender and larkspur. Feeling either satisfied by our collaboration or eager to earn the future business of this few-stem vase weirdo, the florist gifted me the stems free of charge. I felt like the specialest, [softest boi](https://www.vice.com/en/article/is-this-love-or-dopamine-book-extract)!
