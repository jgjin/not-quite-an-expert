As a full-stack programmer, I'd like to use VS Code for my backend (Python) and frontend (TypeScript React).

I'd like to, if VS Code didn't take _seconds_ and a _loading bar_ to follow code definitions in Python. My desire to depend on fewer tools takes a back seat to my desire to get the job done efficiently, [hence why I moved from Spacemacs (Emacs) to VSpaceCode (VS Code) in the first place]({{< ref "vs_code.md" >}}).

So I gave in to my coworkers and downloaded PyCharm. I tried to mirror my VSpaceCode configuration in PyCharm, so at this point I'm using Vim inside Emacs inside VS Code inside PyCharm. Compound chaos.

PyCharm works like a charm to follow code definitions in Python, which makes sense given its specialization. However, I had to disable notifications from PyCharm. Yes, I understand notifications increase engagement for your business. No, I don't want to serve as the problem for your solution. Really, I just want to write.
