I've been wanting to read briefly about the foundations of philosophy, including metaphysics (what exists), epistemics (what we know), and ethics (what we consider right).

At this point, I've become comfortable with [eating alone]({{< ref "community_table.md" >}}). So today I, by myself with a book in hand, headed over to the Vietnamese restaurant near my apartment.

Mmm, mmm, mmm, some good eatin':
1. On my table, phá»Ÿ with bone marrow
2. On the table to my left, my stranger's friend's dad wouldn't let the friend become a bartender like him
3. On the table to my right, my stranger's friend is going through a physiosocial dry spell, in incredible detail

I had put down my very short introduction to metaphysics to tune into the un-real tea.
