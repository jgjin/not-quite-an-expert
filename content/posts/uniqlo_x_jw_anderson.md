Why isn't the toilet flushing? Maybe something clogged the pipes, or water pressure something something, maybe. You engineer software, not hardware; you can't tell. You don't know shit, so now you know shit water, plunging it over, and over, and over until the water level recedes into the porcelain throne. You think some of the literal doo-doo water splashed onto you. Though best not to think, best to wash your hands of the whole situation by filing an urgent maintenance request.

The next day the plumber didn't come and the plunger "didn't work" for your roommate.

You know, I bought a nice shirt recently: an oversized oxford shirt from the ["mass-boutique" collaboration]({{< ref "mass_boutique_collabs.md" >}}) between Uniqlo and JW Anderson. Prioritizing [substance over optics]({{< ref "hwyl_optics.md" >}}), I eschew the formality of a typical oxford shirt. However, embracing autumnal fashion, I was looking for a long-sleeved layer. I found the oversized oxford shirt struck the right balance between formal and subversive, elevated and accessible.

None of that matters when you're bending over the toilet, plunging someone else's literal doo-doo water, trying to move past the droplets on your arms. No way to look nice, just deal with this shit.
