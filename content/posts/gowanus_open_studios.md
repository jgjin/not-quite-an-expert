On October 18, I went to Gowanus Open Studios, during which hundreds of artists in Gowanus open their studios to the public.

I felt a real high when the artist in fashion noted I clearly cared about fashion. Then I immediately felt a real low when I hugged the artist goodbye out of habit to meet up with my friend, only to re-enter the studio to meet up with that friend who walked in as I walked out.

The experience validated the messiness I'd assumed of the artist’s lifestyle. However, it also surprised me with the demographic diversity of professional artists, more older and East Asian people than I’d imagined.

The lowest low came when I discovered someone had stolen my AirPods Max - Find My reported their location all the way in East Flatbush/Little Haiti, an area with [mixed reputation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brooklyn/comments/v0qlrm/how_is_the_east_flatbushlittle_haiti_area).

Biasing toward action, I took the subway there, then called my friends for counsel. The first friend told me to confront and back off if needed; the second chastised me for even the idea and told me to not confront.

Riding the sunk cost, I walked to the address and peeked in. To my surprise, I saw an older East Asian man washing dishes - maybe an artist!

Following the advice of my second friend, I chose not to confront. I called the NYPD, who basically told me that they couldn't do anything in this case. Out of pettiness, I rang my AirPods Max a few times via Find My, and ended my day knowing more about artists and theft.
