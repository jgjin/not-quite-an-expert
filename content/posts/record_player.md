I watch Steve Guttenberg for the crustiness. The lack of polish suggests an authenticity, an honesty. If audio equipment ever did have a past golden age, Steve embodies it.

As with every Black Friday, I considered buying new audio equipment. In the video above, Steve recommends getting something drastically different. Rather than spending progressively more upgrading the same type of setup, try a different setup. In my case, instead of upgrading my bookshelf speakers, I got an entry-level record player. 

I've got some records arriving soon, some of my favorite albums like _To Pimp a Butterfly_. I feel excited, anticipating how (and if) they sound different playing through analog rather than digital.
