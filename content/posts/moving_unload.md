To avoid some of [the burden I experienced loading my stuff into storage]({{< ref "moving_storage.md" >}}), I booked a mover to drop off and later pick up my U-Box at my new place.

The first mover I booked didn't answer my _six_ attempts to contact. [Having learned to cut my losses earlier]({{< ref "moving_roommate.md" >}}), I canceled that booking.

The next mover I booked answered immediately, and offered to also unload my stuff into my apartment for some extra cash. I took them on the offer.

This offer actually presents a coordination problem. If I pay cash first, the mover could refuse to unload my stuff. If the mover unloads my stuff first, I could refuse to pay cash. Rather than solve with violence, I agreed to pay half upfront, and half at the end. To my benefit, the half at the end also incentivizes the mover to do a good job unloading. 

When the day came, the mover actually didn't ask for half upfront. Interestingly, instead, social trust and reputation kept the offer
to unload my stuff for extra cash together.
