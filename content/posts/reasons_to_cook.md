# Introduction
Since moving to San Francisco, I've cooked fewer times than I can count with my left hand. This seems strange for someone who cares enough about cooking to write about it.

Realizing how little I've cooked recently, I wanted to briefly survey why people cook, why I haven't, and why I'd cook more.
# Reasons other people cook (and why I haven't)
### Economic necessity
The labor of cooking costs money, and if you can do it yourself, you can save that money.[^1] Many people cannot afford to pay someone else to cook for them, because they need to save that money to cover the cost of necessities. Others may still find cooking worthwhile, because they can invest that saved money in a more financially prosperous future.
[^1]: If you can do it for others as well, you can make money.

The labor of cooking also costs time, so finding cooking worthwhile depends on the value of that time. In economic terms, cooking comes with an opportunity cost, the value of other activities you could do instead. These activities could bring you enjoyment, or increase your earning potential. If the value of the best alternative exceeds the net cost of paying someone else to cook, an economically rational actor would prefer paying someone else to cook.

I fortunately don't find myself starved for time; I find room in my schedule to consistently exercise, read, and even practice a new hobby. On the other end of the equation, however, I get free food from my office, and San Francisco has a diverse and numerous collection of good restaurants. This brings the net cost of paying someone else to cook so down that I haven't cooked much.
### Sociability
Shared food brings people together. A shared meal signifies and fosters inter-personal connection, and a shared diet signifies and fosters community.

I used to invite friends over to cook together.[^2] However, my friends in San Francisco prefer to eat at restaurants, again because the city has a diverse and numerous collection. Reflected by these restaurants, San Francisco encompasses a wide array of diverse, interacting communities. No single dish I could cook would make me feel wholly "San Franciscan," so cooking does not make me feel closer to my geographic community.
[^2]: using the subscription meal kits I'd snag discounts on.
# Reasons I'd cook more
### Meditation
People often describe entering the shower as entering a state of deep thoughtfulness. Cooking alone just for myself transports me to a similar state. Many recipes ask only part of your attention, so while going through the steps you can explore what goes through your mind, or engage directly and deeply with the music you're listening to. 
### Accomplishment
A lot of "knowledge work" lacks tangible end results. Programming sometimes leaves me craving something I can see, touch - something I can eat? Cooking gives you physical results quickly and frequently, and a tasty final product makes you feel accomplished.
# Conclusion
I really do want to cook more; this week I'll order a subscription meal kit on discount.
