# Introduction
When we use the verb _to be_ we can mean a lot of things, including, but not limited to:
1. Identity: "I am Steve."
2. Inclusion/exclusion: "The tomato is a fruit."
3. Predication: "They are excellent."
4. Existence: "There is a reason."
5. Location: "She is there."
# To be, or not to be
The versatile roles _to be_ plays can lead to ambiguity. For example, if I say "this food is good," what do I really mean? 

If I temporarily avoid using _to be_, I could specify: "you cooked this food skillfully," "this food tastes good," or "this food serves a positive moral purpose."
# E-prime
E-prime[^1] is English excluding all forms of _to be_.[^2] People advocate using E-prime for more precise language, such as the example above.
[^1]: E-prime seems to come from the math tradition of using "prime" to denote a next related version of an entity, particularly a subset. "Prime" could also serve as a pun, as in "a prime (higher-quality) form of English."
[^2]: The irony of using _to be_ in this definition is not lost upon me.
# When (not) to use E-prime
E-prime, in eliminating the ambiguity of _to be_, fits well in technical writing. "Technical" here refers to a need for precision, and "writing" here refers to any medium of communication not in real time. While drafting a philosophy paper, engineering specification, or sensitive text, E-prime can help you clarify your thinking and meaning.

Last year, I tried to integrate E-prime into my everyday conversations. I no longer use E-prime when speaking face-to-face for 2 reasons:
1. The awkward pause of trying to think of an alternative to _to be_ can shift the tone and interrupt the flow of conversation.
2. Avoiding _to be_ can result in noticeably awkward phrases, especially in the heat of the moment grasping for alternatives to _to be_. "The tomato is a fruit" becomes "The tomato constitutes a member of the fruit family." _Oof_. 
# Conclusion
If you are going to experiment with E-prime, I would suggest E-prime light. E-prime light is E-prime allowing _to be_ to be used as an auxiliary verb: E-prime light allows "Y'all are sleeping on this new artist," whereas E-prime does not. E-prime might help you improve your communication, or it might not be right for you.
