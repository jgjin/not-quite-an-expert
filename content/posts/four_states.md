[The Four Corners Monument marks the "quadripoint" where the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah meet.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Corners_Monument) If you stretch yourself out, you can place a limb in each state.

In my mind, I'm playing a solo game of Twister, a limb contorted into each state of Stupid, Bold, Idiosyncratic, and Proficient.
