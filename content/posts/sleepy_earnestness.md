Earlier this year, in the face of a brutal insomnia that reduced me to less than 6 hours of sleep per day, I asked my friend how to sleep.

A few months before, this friend had discovered a tumor in their brain. The tumor had distorted their sleep cycle enough to intrigue a panel of researchers.

I got some sleep and health advice from my friend. More importantly, I gained perspective.

In this life, you can't guarantee sleep; you can't guarantee wellness; you can't guarantee certainty. Despair will get you nowhere, because in despair you do nothing. And so you must face your life with as much earnestness as you can muster, and do what you can.
