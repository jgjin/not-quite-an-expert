As the title declares. The first time, our lease expired and my roommate wanted to live in a different neighborhood. The second time, just one month later, I needed a better place to sleep than the second floor overlooking the highway. The third time, I took a job in another city.

The first time, I suffered chaos by my procrastination and permissiveness. By the third time, I learned to act and communicate early, and set clear expectations; my third move went as well as it could have (except one broken mug).

I became upsettingly good at packing. My friends and even the movers complimented my packing. Get yourself some vacuum bags, extra cardboard boxes, and moving blankets.

Though young adults move a lot, 3 times in the same year feels almost obscene, doesnâ€™t it?
