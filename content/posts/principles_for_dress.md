I've started to dress better for others (for me). And since I deliberate and iterate[^1] so intensely, I've also started to listen to a podcast about clothes.
[^1]: mayhaps fixate

In the episode ["How To Dress"](https://articlesofinterest.substack.com/p/how-to-dress) of _Articles of Interest_, the founder of Tibi lays out principles for how to dress, an enticing framing for a mind afflicted with [Engineers' Disease](https://www.velcro-city.co.uk/epistemic-humility-vs-the-engineers-disease) (ED).

After visiting Tibi's flagship store in SoHo to read _The Creative Pragmatist_, the book behind the episode, I'd claim very few principles for dress generalize well across people and time. However, I've found these principles generalize pretty well, from most to least generalizable:
1. Choose a simple set of [values]({{< ref "values_choices.md" >}}) to motivate your wardrobe
2. Procure solid basics, including "the right jeans, the right tee, the right blazer, the right dress pant, and the right sweat pant" to build up your wardrobe
3. Pick "one, ton, or none" pops of color (and/or texture) for a harmonious outfit
4. Mix loosely and tightly proportioned pieces for a more interesting outfit

Though, as the episode emphasizes, treat these as guidelines, not hard and fast rules.
