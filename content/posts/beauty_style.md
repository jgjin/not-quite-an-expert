# Introduction
A quick post on a useful distinction.
# Beauty
Beauty is socially defined. What is beautiful is almost always exclusive, like being young or rich. Imagine a runway model.
# Style
Style is individually defined. You can be stylish at any age, at any level of wealth, no matter the circumstances of your birth. Imagine a drag queen.
# Conclusion
I am still trying to find my style.
