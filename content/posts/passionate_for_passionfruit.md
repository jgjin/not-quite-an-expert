I go through fruit phases. Previously, I had a real lychee moment; now I find myself passionate for passion fruit!

Besides the fun name, passion fruit epitomizes tart citrus flavor. In the office I down cans of passion fruit-flavored LaCroix; in the apartment I down cans of passion fruit-flavored Spindrift.

Or at least, I was downing Spindrift when I could find it! Their new passion fruit flavor now sells out before I can get my hands on it. Now I have to turn to alternative avenues for sour, sour passion fruit flavor.

Fortunately, [Goya sells passion fruit pulp](https://www.goya.com/en/products/passion-fruit-pulp) which I can use to make my own syrup. I live near Alphabet City, historical home of [Nuyoricans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuyorican). That means I live close to some Hispanic grocers, and there I can buy Goya passion fruit pulp!

Iâ€™ll update when I actually make the passion fruit syrup.
