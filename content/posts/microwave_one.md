# View I
_Microwave Cooking for One_ represents the height of laziness! You can't bother yourself with preparing a proper meal; you can't even bring yourself to talk to the delivery driver. You filth! You, utter, utter, _filth_! For _once_, get out of your bed or off of your couch. For _once_, stop binging your favorite show for the tenth time and do _something_! No, shoving three things into the microwave doesn't count. Did you do the thing I asked you to do two days ago? No? _Of course you didnt_.
# View II
_Microwave Cooking for One_ shines a ray of hope in the darkness of modern living. I work _crazy_ hours. I wish I didn't have to, yet I feel grateful for the opportunity, or rather, the ability. You know, some people, like my aunt.... _Um_...I wish I could cook myself something nice, you know, something more than a microwave dish. After work, after _all that_, I just can't find the energy. And microwave cooking doesn't make me feel as bad as fast food for the _fourth time in a row_, you know? Maybe someday I will have _more_. I am doing the best with what I have _now_, or at least, I think I am.
# View III
_Microwave Cooking for One_ constitutes everything _wrong_ with society! Technologies like the microwave have made us complacent. They have lowered our standards to the point at which we stand in our homes and eagerly await "microwaved asparagus soup." _Ugh_! Remember when everyone would gather around the dinner table, and _sit_, and dig into _real_ dishes? You know, meat, vegetables, the whole pyramid? How low we have sunk. Every day we stray further from God's light.
# View IV
_Microwave Cooking for One_ lays a path for the future, as time crumbles away the relics of the past. The microwave provides access, _possibilities_, previous unthinkable to the masses. Foods previously requiring _hours_ materializing in mere _minutes_, how wonderful! Yes, it will change our kitchens, change _us_. However, _inevitably_, we change. Did you know [people really didn't care about dinner before the Industrial Revolution](https://www.eater.com/ad/18285548/evolution-family-dinner-history)? To moralize about family dinner ignores the social context that forms our eating habits. No amount of moralizing alone will change the conditions of our society. And maybe, though you haven't accustomed yourself to it, the microwave cooks us a beautiful future. Or, at least, a way to cope.
