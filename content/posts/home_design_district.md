As I walk through the Design District of San Francisco, which houses many interior design showrooms, I see parts of homes. I see shiny model kitchens and bathrooms, even elaborate lamps. However, I don't see "homes."

I don't see "homes," because I know no one is really using these kitchens, bathrooms, nor lamps right now. They currently serve as display and merchandise.

I realize then that my intuitive idea of "home" involves people living. It includes relationships and behaviors, not just stuff - something to keep in mind as I make my "home" in my new place.
