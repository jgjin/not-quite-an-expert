Another subway ride and I brought the vase and micro dried bouquet to the office.[^1] While I lost a few bits of sea lavender and larkspur to the underground, I managed to keep the vase and almost all of the bouquet intact.
[^1]: I often use my office as extra space for my hobbies, so I can keep my smaller NYC apartment tidy.

Dried stems don't need it, so I didn't add water into my vase. However, without anything in the vase, the stems wouldn't stay in place. I adjusted, and readjusted, and readjusted. And the more I adjusted, the more buds of sea lavender flaked, and the more blooms of larkspur broke.

Finally, lightly sweating, yes actually sweating, I resolved to not let [perfect be the enemy of good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good). Perhaps I should take the lesson, or perhaps I should text my friend to get me sand.
