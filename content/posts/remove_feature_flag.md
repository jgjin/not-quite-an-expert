Artificial intelligence (✨AI✨) philosophers think about artificial general intelligence (✨AGI✨), when ✨AI✨ becomes ✨super duper✨ capable, and ✨super duper✨ wild changes occur in society. Some credible philosophers think ✨AGI✨ will come in a few short years.

The last time I used ✨AI✨ to remove a fully enabled feature flag, it made 3 attempts:
1. In the first attempt, it replaced the feature flag enumeration value with a bunch of comment delimiters - I'd rather it delete the value, though fine -  "oops, let me try again"
2. In the second attempt, it replaced the bunch of comment delimiters with a single comment delimiter - again I'd rather it delete the value, though fine - "oops, let me try again"
3. In the third attempt, it didn't even show me what it did, it just gave up - "you'll just have to do it yourself"

So I guess I'm still waiting for ✨AGI✨. Maybe it'll come after mass self-driving cars.
