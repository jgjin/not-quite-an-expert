When I play [guitar]({{< ref "instruments.md" >}}), the notes A, C, and E form the A minor chord. The notes A, C#, and E form the A major chord.

When I type on [my stenotype keyboard]({{< ref "stenotype.md" >}}), the chord [HAOEL pressed simultaneously](https://sites.google.com/site/learnplover/lesson-3-english-sounds/3A-vowels/3a-2-long-vowels) forms "heel." The chord [HAEL pressed simultaneously](https://sites.google.com/site/learnplover/lesson-3-english-sounds/3A-vowels/3a-4-vowel-disambiguators) forms "heal."

When I write Chinese, the [simplified Han characters]({{< ref "language_history.md" >}}) 花 and 园 form the [segment]({{< ref "cjk_segmentation.md" >}}) 花园, meaning garden. The characters 花 and 椒 form the segment 花椒, meaning Sichuan [peppercorn]({{< ref "peppercorn.md" >}}).

Look at all those links to other posts! I've started to notice the idea of "chords" across domains. You can combine notes, keys, characters, whatever you'd like to call them, to form distinct _meanings_. 

The combinations as wholes carry more weight than the sum of their constituents; elements bond to form a compound of entirely unique properties. Listen to the music of "chords" all around you!
