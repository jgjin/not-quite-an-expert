The laws of nature dictate that whenever I, your beloved not-quite-an-expert, get a new computer JANK™ ensues.

As I mentioned recently, my previous laptop stopped charging. Before you ask, I would like to know why it stopped charging as well. I didn't dunk it into a swimming pool; it just suddenly stopped charging.

To replace it, I bought an HP Envy x360. And within the first week, the Wi-Fi stopped working. Not as in it had trouble connecting from time to time. This new laptop straight up would not even scan for networks.

A question for you, dear reader: how do you download something to fix your computer that won't download anything? Facetious, of course. I suppose I could put something on a USB. However, thinking outside the box, I've decided to put the HP Envy x360 back into the box and return it.

I then got a new Mac. You might remember [my post about deciding to get one]({{< ref "mac_convert.md" >}}). I originally wanted to write a series of posts on configuring this Mac. However, JANK™ cares not for my plans. While reinstalling macOS (I wanted a fresh start after a particularly frustrating attempt to install a window manager), [I got a "personalization error"](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211983).

A question for you, dear reader: how do you fix a computer which can no longer perform basic operating system operations? Perhaps start from scratch and reinstall the OS; you know, how I ended up here in the first place. I had to return the Mac as well.

By now, I've learned to sail the Sea of JANK™ that bursts forth from every new computer I purchase. My next Mac comes next week. Fingers crossed.
