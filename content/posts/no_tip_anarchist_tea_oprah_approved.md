Sometimes I buy tea (or coffee) for the story, rather than for the taste. For example, when I visited Ann Arbor again, I bought [Miss Kim x Zingerman's Deli black tea](https://shop.zingermansdeli.com/product/miss-kim-jeju-forest-black/2780).

Miss Kim stands out to me as one of the only no-tip (living wage) restaurants I've eaten at.[^1] [They actually belong to the Zingermanâ€™s Community of Businesses](https://misskimannarbor.com/about), started by Paul Saginaw and Ari Weinzweig [(who studied anarchism and Russian history at the University of Michigan)](https://www.vice.com/en/article/how-zingermans-turned-anarchy-and-pastrami-into-a-60-million-business) and originally famous for their deli's reuben sandwich. Today, you can see quotes on their wall from Obama, and more entertainingly, Oprah, [who proclaimed "on a scale of 1 to 5...11"](https://www.oprah.com/food/gayle-kings-search-for-americas-best-sandwich/9).

Given the businesses focus on products quite different from tea, I knew the tea wouldn't blow me away. In fact, it tastes like run-of-the-mill black tea. However, you bet I told every coworker who would and wouldn't lend me an ear the _story_ of the tea.
