[Airlines engage in price discrimination to get as much money as they can from customers.]({{< ref "price_discrimination.md" >}}) This includes multiple strategies, most obviously classes of tickets.

For customers who want to (or can only afford to) pay less, you can get a basic economy ticket, without refunds, exchanges, nor seat assignment.

And on the opposite end, for customers who can pay more (often on their company's dime), you can get a business class ticket, with big seats, big thanks, and big contempt for the riffraff behind (i.e. below) you.
