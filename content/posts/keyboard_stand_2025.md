Sure, [a sit-stand desk serves as the best “ergonomic keyboard”]({{< ref "ergo_keyboards.md" >}}). Though what if I want to sport ergonomically limp wrists at my sit-stand desk?

Exploring the wider possibilities of keyboard stands, I found inspiration leveraging other existing systems for electronics, with [tripod clamps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyqRtHL9M7Y) and [MagSafe connections](https://evantravers.com/articles/2023/04/06/magsafe-tenting-and-wearable-keyboards).

Sure, clamping my split keyboard to my desk makes me look a lil crazy, like either a 0.5x or a 2x engineer. However, based on my calculations (0.5 * 0.5 + 0.5 * 2.0 = 1.25), I've become a 1.25x engineer in expectation.
