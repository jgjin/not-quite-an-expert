"Mocktails" refers to non-alcoholic drinks mocking alcoholic cocktail drinks. I don't like the term "mocktails."

"Mocktails" implies a natural, superior alcoholic and an imitation, inferior non-alcoholic. However, non-alcoholic drinks have some advantage of flavor and flexibility. Alcohol tastes bitter and burns your throat, because your body recognizes it as toxic; non-alcoholic drinks don't have to "overcome" that taste hurdle. And most people aren't trying to get sch-wasted on a workday; they could then drink something non-alcoholic without guilt.

"Mocktails" also implies a value judgment against people who don't drink, for whatever reason - a sort of stickler, "anti-fun" connotation. Obviously, people who don't drink still have fun, just without alcohol.

Note I'm **NOT** making a value judgment against alcoholic drinks. Of course, I recognize people drink socially to get buzzed, to get drunk, to get sloppy, and non-alcoholic drinks can't really do that. I drink, and getting buzzed feels fun. 

Non-alcoholic drinks shine, not in trying to replace alcoholic drinks, instead in flavor, flexibility, and health. As such, I call them "zero-proof" or simply "non-alcoholic" drinks, or by their specific name.
