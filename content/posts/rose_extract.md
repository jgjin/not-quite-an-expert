Today I bought roses from Trader Joe's. The cashier probably thought I was buying them for my girlfriend.

I don't have a girlfriend. I chopped the heads off the roses, and flayed the petals into a glass bottle, to drown in cheap vodka. 

If that description doesn't make it clear, I'm making rose extract. To mix with lychee in sparkling water.
