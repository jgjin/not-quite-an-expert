Yeah, I put the "mentalist" in "environmentalist"! So upon rethinking my cleaning supplies, I bought the concentrate, instead of the plastic bottle, of Method foaming hand soap. I already had a reusable soap dispenser from when I wanted to scent my own soap.

However, when I mixed the soap concentrate into my soap dispenser, it didn't foam because I didn't have a _foaming_ soap dispenser. I felt like a soap dummy!

The next day, I noticed the office had the same Method foaming hand soap, except prebottled in a disposable plastic foaming soap dispenser. Since we had nearly finished the bottle, I asked the cleaning staff if I could take the bottle home, and they approved.

Back in my apartment, I transferred the soap from my soap dispenser to the plastic bottle. To my delight, it foamed! I felt like a silly soap smartie, having basically made the same soap in an extremely roundabout way.
