Doing a bit can activate your fight-or-flight response.

Fight - look your manager in the eye on the last day of your internship and bite into a banana unpeeled - CRONCH.

Flight - run through the kind-of restricted area of the public garden, and to the horror of the kindly approaching family and your new shoes, step in a covered puddle - SPLOOSH.

Really fun either way.
