Have you experienced limbo? Or rather the airport food court.

Once through security, the airport before flights represents a rare broad space where you don’t have to do anything. At the same time, you can do many things, and most luxuriously, nothing.

Nothing, I don’t find much room for nothing. Nothing can really help you think, or process. What you do during nothing lays bare your defaults. Wrangle your children? Potato about? Eat? For me, I’m catching up on writing.
