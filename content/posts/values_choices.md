I like Rust, a lot:

I like [Rust's mascot, Ferris the crab](https://rustacean.net). Ferris puns on Rust, and "Rustacean" (the term for a Rust enthusiast) puns on crustacean.

While scuttling around Ferris, I ran into Ferris's creator's website. On it, Ferris's creator declares:
> Company values are useless if they're just generic good things anyone would want. A meaningful value is something whose opposite could be a different company's value. True values are choices.

Almost anyone who's worked at a company can attest to these "generic good things anyone would want" values. For example, if we go through [Amazon's page on company values](https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/leadership-principles), I count 12 generic values and 4 (italicized) non-generic values:
1. Customer Obsession - what company would openly spurn customers?
2. Ownership - what company would want workers to disown their work?
3. ***Invent and Simplify***
4. Are Right, A Lot - what company would want wrong judgements?
5. Learn and Be Curious - what company would want to ignore new knowledge?
6. Hire and Develop the Best - what company would want to hire and develop the worst?
7. Insist on the Highest Standards - what company would openly insist on the lowest standards?
8. Think Big - what company would want to think small?
9. ***Bias for Action***
10. Frugality - what company would want to waste resources?
11. Earn Trust - what company would want to breed mistrust?
12. ***Dive Deep***
13. ***Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit***
14. Deliver Results - what company would avoid results?
15. Strive to be Earthâ€™s Best Employer - what company would strive to be the worst employer?
16. Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility - what company would proudly shirk responsibility?

As a heuristic of [substance versus optics]({{< ref hwyl_optics.md >}}), consider which of your company's values pass the opposite test demonstrated above.
