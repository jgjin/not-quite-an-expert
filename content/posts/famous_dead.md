This week, I put in my 2-week notice. And suddenly, everyone wanted to chat.

I don't feel salty, though. I feel grateful, and a bit baffled, by the sheer number of people with whom I've connected while working at Glean.

And I feel genuinely uplifted by the many people who've told me that they've liked working with me, and they've liked me.

Bittersweet the notion that this era of me is coming to an end.
