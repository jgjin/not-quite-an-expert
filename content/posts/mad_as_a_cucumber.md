I had a cucumber dish that made me _mad_.

To avoid the long line at Ichiran, I diverted to Bites of Xian, and ordered the garlic cucumber.

Some bites tasted so sweet, like nasty candy, that it made me _mad_.

Other bites tasted so weirdly spicy, in my nose and in the back of my head, that it made me _mad_.

And they served the cucumber in such big, unwieldy chunks that it made me _mad_.

And they served it in such a sloppy, wasteful plastic bin that it made me _mad_.

Then I realized Bites of Xian didn't spin off Xi'an Famous Foods, which made me _mad_, because they showed off a picture of the head of Bites of Xian giving a talk with [Maye Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maye_Musk#Politics), which made me _mad_.

It made me so _mad_ that I considered dumping the cucumbers into the compost bin. However, they didn't have a compost bin, which made me _mad_. So I just sat there, seething, choking down the cucumber, cursing the poster of the head of Bites of Xian.
