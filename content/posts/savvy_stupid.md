At the Chicago "L" train station, a kindly Chinese grandma approached me, asking me to sign her petition, to end the Communist Party of China (CPC).

I can't tell how how a petition would end the CPC. However, I can tell what organization someone like this would belong to. [The same one that performs Shen Yun: the Falun Gong, or Falun Dafa.](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/stepping-into-the-uncanny-unsettling-world-of-shen-yun)

On the back of the pamphlet, I spotted the website of The Epoch Times. [Published by the Falun Gong,Â The Epoch Times has embraced far-right politics, peddling misinformation including anti-vaccine screeds.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/24/technology/epoch-times-influence-falun-gong.html) The Falun Gong have found a curious coalition in their fight against the CPC.

Savvy to this, I acted stupid. I pretended to not understand Chinese, and refused to sign the petition. After I got off the L train, I threw the pamphlet away, grateful I avoided some sketchy email newsletter.
