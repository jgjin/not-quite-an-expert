When you buy a product, you pay for function and aesthetics. By "function", I mean the product does something useful, and by "aesthetics", I mean everything we could vary while maintaining the same function, especially how the product _appears_.

I understand the distinction between function and aesthetics becomes hazy depending on people's values. However, I wouldn't consider it arbitrary. Some of it comes from the world - a world where people must eat, for example, [about which I have a _lot_ to say]({{< ref  chili_butter_importance.md >}}).

Nearly every product incorporates aesthetics. So we must consider what aesthetics we encourage and discourage in ourselves and others.

I dislike and try to discourage aesthetics based on [exclusivity/beauty]({{< ref beauty_style.md >}}) outside the reach of an average person's splurge.

You know what falls outside that reach? "Luxury goods", like certain watches and fragrances. I have a bone to pick with Hwyl, Aesop's currently $160 fragrance, that I'll break down in subsequent posts.
