I've been using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) more and more, not just for writing posts here, also for writing messages in Slack and writing documents in Notion.

As detailed in [this article](https://ia.net/topics/markdown-and-the-slow-fade-of-the-formatting-fetish), Markdown emphasizes structure over presentation, which works well for my job in which I prioritize [substance over optics]({{< ref "hwyl_optics.md" >}}). I consider the simple structure of Markdown a feature rather than a bug, since it takes effort to extract the substance and express something simply.
