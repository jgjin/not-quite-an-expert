Tonight, for the first time in years, I ate another 7-Eleven taquito - monterey jack, the objectively superior flavor. 

$1.50 - more expensive than I remember, though it tasted exactly the same.

Iâ€™ve eaten so much fancy - expensive, sometimes delicious, food since then. However, no matter how many omakases, or fusion burritos, or "celebrations of sungold tomatoes" I consume, I still come back to the 7-Eleven taquito. In fact, in time, in memory, after a late night, after a long flight, I embody the 7-Eleven taquito more than any fancy food. And that feels good. Actually, not good, right, except in my stomach.
