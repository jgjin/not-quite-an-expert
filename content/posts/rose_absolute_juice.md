After [soaking the rose petals in ethanol]({{< ref "rose_absolute_solvent_extraction.md">}}), and filtering out the petals, I now have a jar of what looks like pee. I gotta concentrate the good good stuff in the pee jar to get a sufficiently potent rose adulterate.

In sufficient concentration, next to an open flame, ethanol will EXPLODE. A lil quirky, I know, I donâ€™t like to EXPLODE. So I need to evaporate the ethanol without an open flame; I pull out my instant pot for the first time in weeks.

My chemist friend warned me to keep the vessel from tipping over in the makeshift water bath. An expert would. Not quite an expert, I briefly leave the kitchen and come back to an instant pot filled with _rose juice_ - water, ethanol, and rose. And now I have to evaporate the water as well.

Over an hour later, dripping with vaguely rose-smelling sweat, I have only water and rose remaining.[^1] Ready to explode, I evaporate the rest in a small pot.
[^1]: because ethanol evaporates at a lower temperature than water
