While woodworking my own wall shelf, I needed to drill large holes into the body of wood. 

In the public makerspace, someone was helping me drill. On the fifth hole, we broke through the surface of the wood.

Oh no! The other guy looked a bit panicked.

Not me, though (after a second). I took this as an opportunity to learn about repairing wood.

People say you (should) learn from mistakes. Then we should feel eager about making mistakes in lower-stakes environments, like, you know, woodworking your own wall shelf.
