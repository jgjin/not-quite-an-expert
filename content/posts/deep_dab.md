Memes live through curious stages. After entering the mainstream, memes sometimes re-surface _ironically_, as if to meme on of their own mainstream-ness. After Clinton dabbed on The Ellen Show, dabbing did just that.

For those of you not familiar with dabbing, or specifically _deep_ dabbing:
{{< youtube PVHxztbT71o >}}

In the summer of 2019, I lived in a _massively_ shared house with over 20 other people. Yes, _over 20 others_. One day, we decided to venture to the local public park to play Ultimate Frisbee, the Official Sport of Frat and Tech Bros. 

New to the sport, I did not play Ultimate Frisbee well. To contribute to my team, I encouraged my teammates to deep dab whenever they scored. Everybody knows the deep dab raises team morale sky high. To my disappointment, my teammates only performed shallow dabs, kiddie pool dabs, if you will. With each score-dab, I more passionately requested greater depth in the dabbing motion.

Suddenly, extremely unexpectedly, I scored a point. In that moment, the meme beam did a hard U-turn back to its source. My teammates _demanded** I deep dab to celebrate my score. A victim of my own dab passion, I committed fully to this deep dab. It all culminated to this: the Most Important Dab. I shot into dabbing stance, and aimed my elbow to the ground.

**_Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiip_**

Before I could make contact with the grass, a loud rip pierced the air. I quickly shifted my gaze to the source and discovered, in the middle of a _public_ park, that I had tore a hole down the center of my shorts. Not a small hole, mind you, a near-public-indecency-if-I-didn't-have-boxers-on hole.

In addition to signifying my ruined shorts, that rip marked the end of the game. I could not, or should not in the view of innocent families, play anymore frisbee. To the benefit of the public, a kind housemate lent me their towel, and we walked back to the house.

I leave you with 2 super serious lessons:
1. Prepare flexible pants for deep dabbing
2. Commit to the meme - I would happily deep dab so hard my shorts rip in the no zone again
