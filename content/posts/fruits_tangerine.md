In my workplace, I've adopted the tangerine as my symbol.[^1] For example, I react to Slack messages with :shrugging-tangerine:, :thinking-tangerine:, and :approving-tangerine: generated from [Google's Emoji Kitchen](https://emojikitchen.dev). I've even presented to all hands with slides featuring tangerines!
[^1]: A business person would call it part of my "personal brand".

Coworkers often wonder why tangerines. Well, I have a few reasons:
# Accessible
Tangerines, like chocolates, represent the bounties of the global food trade. For a price nearly anyone can afford, I can enjoy the tangy and sweet juice of this orange treasure!

Tangerines have become so common that they have their own emoji: U+1F34A üçä. That means I can proliferate tangerines on any text surface, including code review comments and internal wiki articles!
# Versatile
Tangerines have flavors versatile enough for drinks, desserts, or simply eating whole! Biologically, citrus fruits like tangerines hybridize easily and quickly, facilitating complexity, [fragrance]({{< ref "my_fragrance.md" >}}), and robustness. I aspire to do the same.
# Fun
Slipping into more base rationale, [like with obscenities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it), I know fun when I see it. I want to bring fun with me, for myself and others. The fun comes from an appropriate, or an inappropriate, tangerine.
