To bike regularly in San Francisco, you must glance at death.

Last weekend, I learned that [helmets don't really help bikers if they seriously crash with a car](https://slate.com/technology/2023/01/bike-helmets-cyclist-deaths-do-you-need-to-wear.html). I also almost crashed twice, while in the bike lane.

The first time, a car swung open its door into my bike lane. I braked quickly enough to avoid a serious collision. Yet I still bumped my hand against the door. The driver and I checked with each other, found nothing concerning, and both brushed it off.

The same ride, another car swung open its door into my bike lane. Thankfully, I braked quickly enough, again. However, the guy (staring at the phone screen) didn't even notice me, and had blocked the entire bike lane with the door! I sat there, _seething_, for a bit, decided not to confront, and biked around the blocking car.

I still bike, because I see biking as good for convenience and community. I must stay vigilant, and a little angery.
