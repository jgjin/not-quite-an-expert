How can people best work with you? If you have a well-meaning organization, or at least team, you can tell them. Inspired by [this example](https://lg.substack.com/p/the-looking-glass-a-user-guide-to), a wrote [a user guide about myself](https://bit.ly/jason_user_guide). It contains:
1. Styles of communication 💃🕺
2. Areas of strength 🦸
3. Opportunities for growth 💪
4. Paths of trust ⛓️
5. Methods of feedback 🪞
6. Views of success 🎗️
