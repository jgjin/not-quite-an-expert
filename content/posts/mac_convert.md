# Introduction
In high school. I wanted to become a _computer person_. Sure, I had dabbled with HTML/CSS before. However, in my mind a _computer person_ had 3 things:

1. proficiency in a _real_ programming language
2. a powerful laptop
3. strong opinions

Already a Holder of Strong Opinions, I eagerly pulled up an online Python class on Udacity. Armed with the free time of spring and summer break, I charged through the class at a pace of one day per one week's worth of material. Soon enough, I could write cool (i.e. badly structured, generally useless, really just all-around non-Pythonic) Python programs!
# PC 
Now I just needed a powerful laptop. I conducted hours of laptop research. Hours! With the diligence of a true _computer person_, I pulled up multiple top laptops lists and cross-referenced their rankings. Despite considering so many options, however, one thing stayed clear in my mind: I would get a PC, not a Mac.

Knowing myself, I can trace my preference to a strong aesthetic distinction between PC and Mac. I thought of Macs as expensive, pretty black boxes and PCs as cheaper, tinker-able white boxes, the first for _suckers_ and the latter for _compuer persons_. Stepping back into that old mindset, I would criticize Mac owners as loyal beyond practical.

However, in hindsight that criticism applies more to me. For my first laptop, I bought a Dell XPS 13. It broke within a year or so. For my second laptop, I bought a Dell XPS 13. It broke within a year or so. My mom joked: "are you eating these laptops?" And still yet, for my third laptop, I bought a Dell XPS 13. It recently stopped charging.
# Mac
Finally, after three XPS 13s over four years, I have dropped my spurned loyalty and bought a MacBook Air.[^1] From the ashes of my trio of broken XPS 13s, I have evolved into a _neo-computer person_! A _neo-computer person_ casts their strong opinions aside when pragmatic. A _neo-computer person_ evaluates alternatives in good faith, and by that I mean _actually tries owning a MacBook to see how it works out_.
[^1]: Technically, I bought an HP Envy x360 to try first. However, in this first week, as if struck by a vengeful and bitter Michael Dell himself, the HP Envy x360 wouldn't even scan for Wi-Fi networks.

I still have lingering doubts, however, about owning a Mac. The strongest goes back to the black box nature of the Mac. Having run Linux for so long, I find myself fighting macOS to express my style of customization. Beyond customization, I have never quite liked Apple's black box ecosystem. I worry one day I will find myself locked out of my favorite programs with no recourse except to leave the black box entirely.
# Conclusion
However, the principle of exploration rises above the rest. Maybe upon examination the black box will have greater transparency than I imagined (I hope so!). At the very least, I hope this Mac [doesn't start smoking]({{< ref "smoking_backup.md" >}}).
