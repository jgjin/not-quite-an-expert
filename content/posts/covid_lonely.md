I done caught COVID! I tested positive for the first time, three years after the pandemic started.

I spent this week mostly alone. My roommate is still gradually moving in, and for everyone's well-being I didn't go to the office, and canceled my plans with friends.

I recently read _The Lonely Stories_, a collection of essays covering the complexities of loneliness. One of the essays related the writer's experience at the beginning of the pandemic. While it made me grateful for the relatively disease-free path I've had since then, it also reminded me of the intense feelings of loneliness that come with COVID. 

I certainly felt COVID lonely this week.
