I visited two tea shops today. Let me tell you about them!

The first, a seller of herbs and roots (I guess tea counts?), had real [woo-woo](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/woo-woo) energy. One patron asked if sage clears impurities, to bring to a wedding. In my head, I noted that if someone brought an herb to clear impurities to the celebration of my marriage, I'd feel insulted.

The jars of herbs and roots looked a bit stale, assuming dried goods get stale. So I looked in the back, where they were selling "magical space spray" derived from various plants. You know, like chamomile, chrysanthemum, or corn - magical space corn!

As much as I embrace [mindful mommy]({{< ref "mindful_mommy.md" >}})-dom (as a proud owner of a small collection of essential oils), I didn't buy the magical space corn.
