Drinking beverages with complex tastes brings me, and many others, great joy. Like wow, it tastes like _this_, and _that_, and a little like _that_?

However, making beverages with good complex tastes takes a lot of effort, so costs a lot of money. Before I pay the money,[^1] I want to approximate the complex tastes. Tasting notes help that approximation.
[^1]: and the time and effort to procure and prepare

Tasting notes matter more for categories of drinks[^2] with complex and varied tastes. And they better approximate those tastes when referring to other consistent, well-known flavors. For example, I'd say this tea tastes like peach; I wouldn't say this peach tastes like tea.
[^2]: or foods, though drinks can more easily have complex tastes by virtue of liquids' ability to hold many flavors at once
