I got a surprising amount out of copying my friend's keys while staying at their apartment. My friend has pointed out how I often structure my thoughts into 3 points:
# 1. ease
I didn't even need to talk to someone to copy the keys. I just scanned the keys at a machine and that machine cut the key copies within minutes. As noted in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPBH1eW28mo), you can more easily "break" a physical key than a digital key, though you can less easily use a broken physical key than a broken digital key. However, [you can get around digital keys in other ways](https://xkcd.com/538).
# 2. salesmanship
A salesperson might say, "Don't go! I'll give you a discount to reconsider your purchase!" The key-copying machine made an equivalent gesture, offering a discount when I tried to cancel my order. The machine even upsold smoother keys during checkout.
# 3. imprecision
I did pay a bit more for smoother keys. Lining up the smoother key against the original key, I noticed the smoother key actually lacked entire bumps. However, it still worked, and _felt_ smoother, when unlocking the door to my friend's apartment.
