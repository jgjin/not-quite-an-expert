Emerging adulthood describes the period of life emerging from the stability of adolescence toward the stability of adulthood. _In_-stability marks this transition, changing homes, jobs, and relationships. 

Uncertainty has become the greatest feature of my emerging adulthood, excitement and fear for what I will find. However, the global pandemic has formed the most notable feature. I emerged into closed doors - shuttering businesses, social distancing, and mass protests.

I wonder, and worry, that I have grown stunted, that emerging from the chrysalis into such a world has clipped my wings. And yet, it continues.
