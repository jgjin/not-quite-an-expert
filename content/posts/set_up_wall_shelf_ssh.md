I run a music server on my spare [headless computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Unit_of_Computing). However, after running for a few hours, especially after I [suspend to disk](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate), the music server needs to restart. 

Previously, I would connect my headless computer to my projector and keyboard to run some commands. However, with my wall shelf up, and my projector up on it, that takes too much effort now.

So I set up [ssh](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/OpenSSH) into my headless computer to run those same commands. Even seemingly unrelated projects influence each other in a shared space.
