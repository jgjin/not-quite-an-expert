I'm recording my expectations and aspirations before I start at Ramp.
# What I expect
1. Semi-lean startup semi-chaos
2. Fin+tech bro-dom

# What I want
1. Friends among similar-ish peers
2. Fast career growth (I want to get recognized and promoted in 6-12 months)

# What I don't want
1. Unpredictable hours
2. Deep backend-only work
