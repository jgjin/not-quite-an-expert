# Introduction
Well, do you? Because I've got a guide from someone who's not quite an expert: me!
# Step 1: Reconsider
Like most hobbies, mechanical keyboards take time and money. A nice mechanical keyboard could cost you a few hundred dollars. And with the time it takes you to form an opinion on mechanical keyboards, you could instead form an opinion on folding origami, or painting, or [cooking with onions]({{< ref "onions_cont.md" >}}).

Mechanical keyboards are probably most useful for people in technology or technology-adjacent careers. 

Have you started to feel wrist pain from coding 40 hours a week? Then ergonomic mechanical keyboards are for you. 

Maybe you don't code yourself, and half the people in your office do. Then your new mechanical keyboard could help you write emails faster and break the ice with your coworkers (assuming you don't annoy them with your clickety-clack). Or you could just talk to them right now anyway. Perhaps selecting your interests on immediate usefulness isn't the way go.
# Step 2: Pre-built or you-built?
Assuming you still think mechanical keyboards are right for you, you now have to decide if you want to buy a mechanical keyboard pre-built, or assemble and solder the parts yourself.

The advantages of pre-built keyboards are obvious: you save time, and if something goes wrong you can complain to customer support.

There are a few reasons you would build your own keyboard:
1. You have a good chunk of free time, and like building things with your hands.
2. The specific keyboard you want doesn't come pre-built.[^1] 
3. You are a ride-or-die mechanical keyboarder. You would take a bullet for your favorite board. You gush about mechanical keyboards when you can to your friends. When you can't, you go on Reddit to continue gushing.
[^1]: Consider perhaps a very similar keyboard model does come pre-built, however.
# Step 3: Parts
Your basic mechanical keyboard comes in 5 main parts:
1. The PCB (printed circuit board)

Connects all of the underlying components: sockets, diodes, microcontrollers, all of the things you should forget about if you're not building the keyboard yourself. If you are building your own keyboard, keep a steady hand while soldering and good luck!

2. The keyboard switches (a.k.a. keyswitches)

Send a signal to your computer when pressed (e.g. when the switch under the "r" key is pressed, an "r" is sent to the computer). The "mechanics" in the name "mechanical" keyboards. 

The most popular shape of keyboard switches is [Cherry MX](https://www.cherrymx.de/en/mx-original/mx-red.html) and ["Cherry MX clones"](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Category:Clones_of_Cherry_MX_switches). Any Cherry MX switch can be swapped out for any Cherry MX clone, and vice versa.

Switches are primarily categorized by how hard they need to be pressed (actuation force), how they sound ("silent"[^2] or clicky), and how they feel ([linear or tactile](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/mechanical-keyboard-switches,review-4154.html#linear-vs-tactile)). They can also be characterized by travel distance and profile, though I don't find that matters as much.
[^2]: Note "silent" switches are not truly silent. Almost any switch will make some sort of noticeable sound.

The best type of switch is the one that feels best to you (and doesn't bother the people around you). It's hard to tell how a keyboard switch will feel without trying it. Try before you buy, and when that's not possible, buy a small batch before you buy a complete set of switches.

3. The keycaps

Provide labels (e.g. this is the "r" key) and a larger area to press for keyboard switches. If it appeals to you, you can get colored or patterned keycaps to express your style.

4. The case

Houses and protects all of the previously mentioned parts. Once again, you can choose a special color, pattern, or material to express yourself.

5. The firmware

The software inside the keyboard which handles the logic of signals (e.g. when this key, designated the "r" key, is pressed, send an "r" signal to the computer) and modifier keys (Shift, Control, Alt, e.g. when the Shift and "1" key are pressed together, send an exclamation mark). I am a fan of the [open source QMK firmware](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/?id=what-is-qmk-firmware), which allows you to program any keymap you want.

# Conclusion
Now that you have your parts, you can build your own keyboard! Or don't (if you bought a pre-built one)! If you did decide to build your own, be patient, and remember that at the end of it all, you can be the type of person who won't shut up about their keyboard.
