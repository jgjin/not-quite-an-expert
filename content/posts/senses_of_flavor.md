While reading [_How to Taste Coffee_](https://onyxcoffeelab.com/products/how-to-taste-coffee), I've learned that our experience of flavor comprises more than just the sense of taste. It also includes our sense of smell and touch!

For example, [even though roasted coffee has almost no sugar, sweet-smelling aromatics, e.g. vanilla aromas, can create the perception of sweetness](https://paxculinaria.substack.com/p/decoding-the-mysterious-sweetness).

Also, [temperature affects our sensitivity to sweet, savory (umami), and bitter tastes, hence ice cream tastes sweeter when melted](https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2005/12/19/Food-temperature-affects-taste-reveal-scientists).

Interestingly, certain "taste" sensations work through our touch receptors rather than our taste or smell receptors. The burning sensation of pungency (spiciness) and the drying sensation of astringency fall under ["chemesthesis"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemesthesis).
