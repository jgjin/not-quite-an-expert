You can turn any "dumb" electrical device into a "smart" one by plugging it into a smart plug. Then you can automatically schedule turning it on and off.

However, to a person with a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail. Instead of solving the problem with my noisy refrigerator, I just set the refrigerator to turn off around when I expect to sleep and wake up. And now, stuck with a "smart" half-solution, I end up trying to ignore the noisy refrigerator during the day.
