In high school, I played clarinet and listened primarily to classical music (and EDM). Then in my freshman internship I grew sick of it, and sought out new music.

The first album that spoke to me came from Japanese Breakfast. In her debut album _Psychopomp_, and later in her memoir _Crying in H Mart_, she details her mother's death from cancer: the love, the loss, and the yearning. I re-listen and re-read in hard times.

Then in 2021, Michelle Zauner released _Jubilee_, adorned with persimmons. [She explains:](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/japanese-breakfast-jubilee-interview-1168141)
> I had seen an image of these hanging persimmons that are dried during the winter and turned into sweet, dried fruit. And I really like the idea of this very bitter, hard fruit before it’s ripened — on display and slowly maturing and turning sweeter and letting its environment impact it.

Today I bought a fuyu persimmon, hoping to get softer and sweeter with age.
