Exiting the subway, I saw someone who looked _exactly_ like one of my closest friends. They had the same face, the same clothes, and the way they hunched over to dig through their backpack, I wanted to call out to my friend.

I saw the stranger like my friend, and I saw my friend like a stranger, with Circumstance in between. I wondered if they dreamed the same - a job thinking, not needing money, in a quiet home surrounded by more trees than people. However, I knew I wouldn't know, and I moved on.
