A date (who'd recently moved) asked me an out of context question: "So how's dating in New York City?"

A bit surprised, I responded "In New York City, you can find anyone ..." _or any two, or any three, etc._ " ... if you search hard enough."

Though looking around the people close to me (around my age), I see most people dating the same kind of person, staying within the same race and class boundaries. In fairness, you generally want a long-term partner who really understands you, and someone from the same race and class more likely understands you.

However, I sometimes catch myself thinking I _should_ like someone, attaching myself to the fantastical _idea_ of them. I've been trying to meet more frequently, then reflect honestly on how I felt with them.
