[I won't go gentle into that good night](https://poets.org/poem/do-not-go-gentle-good-night), if it's the last thing I do. We all want to live long and well, though different people pursue that in wildly different ways.

On one side, we have the woo-woo warriors, who reject science and embrace energy crystals. Rather, they practice [alternative medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine), including acupuncture, reiki, and [magical space corn]({{< ref "magical_space_corn.md" >}}).

I can sympathize with disillusionment with scientific institutions, [which have a history of unfair, un-scientific prejudice](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2020/07/medical-racism-history-covid-19). However, I still consider the scientific method itself our best method for finding truths in the physical world.

On the other side, we have the bio-hackers, who embrace science and embrace drugs. Rather, they integrate extreme, often obscure, treatments in the name of science,[^1] including supplemented keto diets, closely tracked exercise regimens, and [rapamycin](https://desmolysium.com/longevityranking).
[^1]: sometimes backed by extensive science, sometimes backed by speculation more than science

I can empathize with using scientific principles to try to extend your life. However, if I went on a first date and the other person mentioned their ["longevity protocol (long & technical version)"](https://desmolysium.com/roadmap), I would find [a purse to stuff breadsticks into](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/breadsticks) and run!
