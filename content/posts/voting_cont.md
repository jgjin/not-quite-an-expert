Because I wanted to combine the themes of people and programming, I wrote a short Python script to calculate and visualize outcomes of [the different voting schemes described in my last post]({{< ref "voting.md" >}}).

[This script is available in this public Github repo](https://github.com/jgjin/voting). It provides a detailed example of how different voting schemes can lead to different outcomes [in the `example` directory](https://github.com/jgjin/voting/tree/master/example).
