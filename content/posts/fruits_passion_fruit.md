As I walked out of the store today, I found that I've become more than just a fan for passion fruit; I've become a sucker for passion fruit:
- In [fruit form](https://www.marthastewart.com/how-to-eat-passion-fruit-8665049), I buy
- In [water form](https://shop.biritemarket.com/store/bi-rite-market/products/28008269-bawi-passionfruit-sparkling-agua-fresca-12-fl-oz), I buy 
- In [pulp form](https://www.goya.com/en/products/passion-fruit-pulp), I buy 
- In [chocolate form](https://manoachocolate.com/products/lilikoi-x-passion-fruit-bar-60), I buy
- In [tea tasting notes](https://songtea.com/products/ruby), I buy
- Even for $35, in [coffee tasting notes](https://dayglow.coffee/products/rareglow), I buy!

While I enjoy seeing passion fruit become more mainstream, I no longer just buy every passion fruit variation I see!
