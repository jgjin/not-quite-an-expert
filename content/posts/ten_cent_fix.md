_Just ask the basic questions, and act on the basic answers, and you’ll get surprisingly good results._

My AirPods Max were suffering terrible connectivity. Half of the time, when you put them on, they wouldn’t connect; and when you took them off, they wouldn’t re-connect. I had to keep resetting them.

When I took them to the Apple Store, the Genius told me it would cost $300 to repair them, with no warranty afterward. She straight up suggested to instead buy another one.

Then I did a basic search, and found [this basic answer:](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254898137)
> You can try removing the speakers from the headband and cleaning the contacts. If you take your iPhone sim card tool, there is a hole underneath the mesh ear covers that will release the headband from the speaker by inserting the sim tool.

I bought a SIM card removal tool from Amazon for $0.10 - actually $0.08 after discount with free shipping (riddle me the economics on that one). The package came with a heartfelt letter from the producer who has polio, which I certainly didn’t expect with my tool. 

And it worked! My headphones connect as new now! And I saved over 99.9%!
