I just finished reading _How to Read a Book_ by Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren. Originally published in 1940, the book has aged surprisingly well, save for a few antiquated passages.

Since 1940, the Internet has radically changed how we read. Websites and search engines have largely replaced physical media. And against this unprecedentedly large collection of digital media, their advice, that different pieces deserve different amounts/levels of your time and effort, rings even more true.

However, we can't inspect most digital media exactly like we inspect books; YouTube channels don't have tables of contents. We must develop digital literacy, to navigate the increasingly important and dynamic landscape of digital media. Though the process of understanding remains quite similar, questions of legitimacy and truth grow in concern.
