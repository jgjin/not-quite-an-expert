In one of our many hours-long calls, I was telling my friend about my attempt to mimic Hwyl: [the motivation]({{< ref "hwyl_optics.md" >}}), and [the mixing]({{< ref "rose_absolute_adulterate.md" >}}), and ultimately, [the mess]({{< ref "rose_absolute_juice.md" >}}).

I felt like a mad scientist, or as I explained "this may become my Mindful Mommy Joker moment". I had the essential oils: vetiver, cypress, and frankincense (the most expensive). However, I was roughly approximating the other listed ingredients, obscure fragrance chemicals like eugenol and d-limonene, with other essential oils I had on hand.

As I was talking it through with my friend, I came up with the perfect term: my "Franken-scents".
