This week, I revisited Ann Arbor, the town of my undergraduate years.

Besides the nostalgia for cheap eats, behind the sense of [the same, different]({{< ref "ship_of_mtv.md" >}}), I confronted lost opportunities.

I saw the same buildings, with the same names, without access. I had 4 years to explore museums, concerts, and hidden corners, and instead I learned the parking lot outside my apartment window.

I donâ€™t regret my time in Ann Arbor; I regret not adding a few small final touches. Acting within my [sphere of influence]({{< ref "sphere_of_influence.md" >}}), I have taken the spirit of exploration with me to San Francisco - most weeks I find another piece of the city.
