# Mistaken
In my head I have the extremely loose timeline:
> Some centuries ago, the English colonized America; a few centuries later those colonists declared independence and became the United States of America.

From that timeline, I thought:
> In an effort to establish their own identity, Americans invented new spellings, e.g. "colour" became "color" and "centre" became "center."

as well I thought:
> Further in that effort, Americans reformed their accents, most noticeably going hard on the /r/s after vowels, "hard" not "hahd."
# Corrected spelling
The thought on spelling turns out not quite right (_finally, a truth value for me, not quite an expert!_). American spellings, as they differ from their British counterparts, follow Noah Webster's dictionaries. 

[Webster believed American values superior to European values:](https://boundaryeffects.com/blog/noah-webster-hates-u)
> America ... sees the kingdoms of Europe, [where] the human mind like the body is fettered 'and bound fast by the chords of policy and superstition': She laughs at their folly and shuns their errors

[In 1789, with hope for the new nation, he declared:](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/05/dictionary-wars-peter-martin-excerpt/588586)
> Now is the time, and this the country, in which we may expect changes favorable to language. ... Let us then seize the present moment, and establish a national language, as well as a national government.

Among these "changes favorable to language," seeking an intellectual foundation for American nationalism, Webster advocated simpler spelling closer to pronunciation: "color," "center," and ["cloke" (not all winners, apparently)](http://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/Cloke). Webster did not, however, invent these spellings; he chose them from the inconsistent spellings originating long before his time.
# Corrected accent
On the other hand, the thought on accent turns out backward. Formally, we call pronouncing the /r/ after vowels "rhotic." [Around the turn of the 19th century (after the American Revolution), non-rhotic English took off in England as a signifier of class.](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/29761/when-did-americans-lose-their-british-accents) This accent became standardized as Received Pronunciation (RP) and spread across England as pronunciation tutors taught others to speak _with class_. 
# Still simplified
I find it intriguing that spelling could reveal itself so political. I also find myself surprised the accent I [and many others](https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2018/may/22/received-pronunciation-may-be-dying-out-but-its-passing-is-long-overdue) associate with class comes from such recent artificial origins.

For brevity, this post omits discussion on the many diverse and evolving non-standard American and British accents. For example, some regional New England accents, by no coincidence, bear resemblance to RP. I could go on, though I'll save it for another post.
