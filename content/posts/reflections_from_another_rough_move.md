I've moved every year for the past 4 years. However, this move felt especially rough. After 3 days of packing, staying up until 4 AM, 5 AM, 6 AM, I had to call U-Haul to fix my reservation from Flushing to Park Slope.

Thank goodness I'd hired moving help to move my packed stuff into storage. I spent the day _exhausted_, napping in my friend's sublet before stumbling my way through a delayed bus and a delayed flight back to Michigan in _la madrugada_.

How did I accumulate so much _stuff_? I moved from SF to NYC with 1 U-Box of _stuff_ and now I have 2! Over holiday break I'll audit my spreadsheet of _stuff_ to give some away.
