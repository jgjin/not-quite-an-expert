"What are you thinking about?" I ask my coworker.

"How everything will get more expensive, because of the tariffs." My coworker smacks me with a big, genuine answer.

"Well, better save up." We laugh it off, save it for later because we should work now.

When I meet my coworker, a self-professed Eeyore, over the weekend, they worry about the times. It doesn't feel like the end of the world. Though it doesn't feel certain the world will go on, or more particularly, go on well.

Trying to take care of myself, I head to my workout class. The quinoa-vores in yoga sculpt really do a number on me, so [ripped, heaving](https://genius.com/Perfume-genius-queen-lyrics), I take refuge in the Michelin-starred Sichuanese restaurant nearby.

What can I do about economic recession, or [✨AGI✨]({{< ref "remove_feature_flag.md" >}})? Unfortunately, [choking down the cucumber to reduce food waste didn't reverse climate change]({{< ref "mad_as_a_cucumber.md" >}}). So for now, I'll enjoy this fish blossom, which reminds me of the [squirrel fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel_fish)[^1] I savored as a child.
[^1]: Actually, it looks like they renamed "squirrel fish" to "fish blossom".
