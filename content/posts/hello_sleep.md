[As I researched more on CBT-I]({{< ref "cbt_i.md" >}}), I came across a new book by behavioral sleep medicine specialist Dr. Jade Wu: _Hello Sleep: The Science and Art of Overcoming Insomnia Without Medications_.

I didn't want to unnecessarily add to my growing backlog of books to read, so I looked at the book preview.

I've never felt so _seen_ and _called out_ by a book at the same time! The prologue "Sleep Is a Friend, Not an Engineering Problem" tells the story of Kate, a software engineer with insomnia obsessing over sleep data. I, of course, saw myself in Kate.

Later on, when motivating the book, Wu notes "[experienced specialists] are hard to come by unless you live in San Francisco and have no problem with paying $300 out of pocket per forty-five minute session." That specificity to my recent experience sold the book for me.

I'm now starting to go through the book - I'll let you know if I have any noteworthy experiences.
