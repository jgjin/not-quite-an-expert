Today I met someone who told me they finessed their credit card benefits to save up to a few hundred dollars on food and transportation during their move. When I asked how much they were paying for their new place, they revealed a monthly rent about $1000 more than mine (after splitting with my roommate). 

When trying to optimize money, sweat the big stuff. For most people, that breaks down to 2 foci: rent and income. Saving on rent or growing your income can translate to many, many meals, rides, and hangouts. And certainly to me it seems more efficient when accounting for time spent optimizing.
