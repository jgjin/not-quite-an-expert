# Preparation
* 1 bottle of vinegar from the Safeway you only go to at night with the homeless people
* 1 cucumber from Gus's Community Market, purveyor of fine and un-fine SF brands

1. Try to figure out how to use a mandoline slicer
2. Slice the entire cucumber super thin
3. Almost slice your finger
4. Mix with vinegar in one of your mason jars, of which you now have a menacing amount

# Base
* 1 slice of milk bread from Breadbelly
* 1 glob of mayo from the cheapest brand, because you probably won't use it all anyway
* (Optional) 1 drop of sweat from biking to Breadbelly

1. Cover one side of the bread with mayo
2. Toast for 3 minutes - weirdly soft??
3. Toast for 3 more minutes - burnt black!!

# Toppings
* 1 slab of country pâté from Maison Nico
* A bunch of cilantro leaves
* A few slices of pickled cucumber

1. Cover the burnt side of the bread with pâté, wondering how to pronounce French words
2. Top with cilantro leaves, recalling that time you put cilantro in boba tea in front of your coworkers - you no longer work there
3. Forget about your (now suspiciously old) pickled red onions and layer with pickled cucumber slices

# Meat
* 1 or 2 or whatever slices of whatever meat you have laying around

1. Just finish up the sandwich and eat it, you over-the-top bih
