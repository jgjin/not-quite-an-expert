Lately, I've eaten at a few restaurants, including [Milu](https://www.eatmilu.com) and [Chiko](https://www.chikonyc.com), which feel like restaurants I'd make if I could. I've drawn out some common personally attractive features:
1. Elevated, not pretentious - someone (actually probably many people) put in the effort, and you can actually taste the difference (rather than politely claim to taste a difference)
2. Chinese American - the variety and history of the first and the abundance and experimentation of the latter (also close to home)
3. Focused (specialized) menu - [I do love (and mostly prefer) when someone does a few products super well]({{< ref "hyperspecialization.md" >}})

On "if I could" - I'd want exit money before pursuing an industry with infamously low margins.
