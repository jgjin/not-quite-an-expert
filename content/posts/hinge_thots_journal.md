I've started going on dates! My friend advised me, after we both read [_How to Not Die Alone_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1982120630), that you go on the first date just to figure out if you want to go on a second date. That mindset takes a lot of pressure off me.

That same book recommends reflecting on you and the other person after each date, so I started a dating journal. Following [this template I found](https://medium.com/@LeoGvnage/navigate-the-dating-waters-with-a-dating-journal-d2ca8403a89), each person in my dating journal has 3 sections:
1. Predictions, which will sharpen intuition and combat hindsight bias
2. Pros / cons, which will test the prediction
3. Logs, which will track events, and potentially patterns
