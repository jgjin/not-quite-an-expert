Last time I tried to copy an Aesop fragrance for myself, [it didn't go well]({{< ref "hwyl_reflections.md" >}}). While shopping at Target, I examined the [Dossier](https://dossier.co) bottles and realized an entire secondary industry of copycat fragrances exists. I can buy instead of make copycats!

I first considered buying samples from The Essence Vault, though a [legitimate review](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceclones/comments/10h2phx/a_legitimate_the_essence_vault_review) describes
> None of them smelled anything like the originals, not even remotely close. ... The projection is poor and they do not last very long, maybe 2-3 hours, not that you would want them to last any longer or have better projection. 

It seems like The Essence Vault makes worse copycats than me! I could've guessed the copycat fragrances industry includes soft scams.

[Element Brooklyn seems closer](https://www.reddit.com/r/luxurycandles/comments/1mjibyr/scents_similar_to_aesops_resurrection_hand_wash), and they have an additional selling point of reducing waste. Also (mostly facetiously), I live close enough that I can take up issues with them directly.

I might've [referred myself](https://www.elementbrooklyn.com/pages/refer-a-friend) for my first order ðŸ˜‰. However, my order really went off the rails when I noticed the option to pay by bank deposit. As a _fInAnCiAl tEcHnOlOgIeS pRoFeSsIoNaL_, I thought I could easily conduct an ACH or wire transfer. I found out _after_ I placed the order with bank deposit that my personal bank account doesn't support transfers like that. And now I find myself politely begging to pay for my [copycat soap](https://www.elementbrooklyn.com/products/mandarin-hand-soap-refill)!
