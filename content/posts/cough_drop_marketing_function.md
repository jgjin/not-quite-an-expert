I eat cough drops like candies, so I've thought more than most about cough drops.

Whenever I buy a significant product, I consider how much I'm paying for marketing versus function.

Ricola puts a lot of effort into marketing their mixture of herbs as effective. [However, the label lists menthol as the active ingredient, and the herb mixture as an inactive ingredient.](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/fda/fdaDrugXsl.cfm?setid=4330ee8d-0b37-4a93-886b-5fc6e6598da7&type=display) [Many people have figured this out](https://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/xvik2w/unpopular_opinion_most_off_the_effects_from), enough for [a class action lawsuit](https://legalnewsline.com/stories/631655779-ricola-must-fight-class-action-as-two-claims-over-swiss-herbs-proceed). Needless to say, I don't buy Ricola.

I buy Vicks cough drops, with 20mg of menthol, over Ricola's measly 5mg. It has enough menthol to make me cough!
