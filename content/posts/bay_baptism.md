I have finally moved to San Francisco, one and a half years later than expected.

People attach resolutions to transitions. On top of moving, I have welcomed in the New Year. And after a stagnant year, I have a heaping barrel of resolutions.

When I landed, the Waters of Bay baptized me: from now on, "not quite an expert" has died, and you may call me "Super Expert"!

I'll learn 1 new language, make 20 new friends, visit 300 museums, attend 4000 conferences, and lose 50000 pounds! Just you wait! New year, new city, new me.
