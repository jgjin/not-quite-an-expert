Now that we've [totally completely settled the topic of authenticity]({{< ref chili_butter_east_asian_dairy >}}), what butter do I use for chili butter?

I bought [these fancy Sichuanese chilies](https://themalamarket.com/collections/sichuan-spices-dry-goods/products/sichuan-chili-flakes-xiang-la-jiao-mian), I need fancy butter to match!

Well, French butter of course! As French cuisine personality Julia Child famously said, ["With enough butter, anything is good"](https://www.thekitchn.com/4-things-we-learned-about-butter-from-julia-child-228696). [French butter has a higher butterfat percentage by law.](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/17/dining/butter-with-a-pedigree-ah-the-french.html) And the [private label]({{< ref private_label >}}) Wegmans French butter doesn't cost _too_ much.
