To end 2021, my friend U wanted us to build an easy, simple self-driving vehicle. After settling on the [linorobot](https://github.com/linorobot/linorobot), we just needed to procure parts:
1. Raspberry Pi
2. (Xbox) Kinect sensor
3. Some sort of chassis
4. Other parts

After days of planning and execution, we ended up with:
![An inappropriate linorobot](/inappropriate-linorobot.jpg)

Look at it! Obscene!! It looks like a dildo!!!

U called it "scuffed". However, I call it "fuck-ass",[^1] as in "WHY DID WE MAKE THIS FUCK-ASS DILDO BOT??!!"
[^1]: A term I learned from [a podcast episode](https://play.prx.org/listen?ge=prx_3492_8c80cff3-4dc8-47b0-9db5-d18dadabf1ef&uf=https%3A%2F%2Fpublicfeeds.net%2Ff%2F3492%2Ffeed-rss.xml)

Look, I won't blame anyone; we have a blameless culture here. SOMEONE has scuffed a fuck-ass [rose absolute]({{< ref "rose_absolute_juice.md" >}}) and [wall shelf]({{< ref "mourning_wall_shelf.md" >}}) since, so I think they did it.
