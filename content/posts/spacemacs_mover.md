This time, I hired a mover to move my stuff. Somehow, I found the one mover who also uses Spacemacs, a particular community configuration of Emacs.

Unprompted, the mover told me about [Free Software](https://www.fsf.org/), [Lisp machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine), and [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman). I had only told other people about these topics; it felt almost surreal to have someone tell me, doubly so my mover!

My mover went to UC Berkeley, and had to drop out due to immigration issues. I felt a real kinship, and that mere circumstance kept us in wildly different conditions. So for the first time, I left a 5-star review, and tipped over a hundred dollars.
