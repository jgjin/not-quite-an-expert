# Introduction
Like me, you probably have a list of background to-dos that you want to eventually get around to. They range in importance from big passion projects to small decoration ideas. However, it often seems you just don't have enough time for them. You have work or classes. This week you have an appointment for _this_ or preparation for _that_, so next week probably works better. Or maybe you don't feel you can set aside a long enough chunk of time to really commit to this to-do.
# Making time
I want you to imagine that right now, in your apartment or wherever you live, the power has gone out. All of your neighbors still have power, so you've established the problem comes specifically from the place you live.[^1] In that case, you would _make time_ to fix the power, wouldn't you? Whether you would take a look yourself or call an electrician over, you would _make time_. And suddenly, against the claim that you don't have enough time for anything else, circumstances have forced you to _make time_ for something else. 
[^1]: You can substitute this hypothetical power incident for anything urgent, e.g. your friend calls needing a ride to the hospital.
# Conclusion
For a lot of people, not doing their background to-dos doesn't come from a lack of time. Actually, perhaps accidentally, you have expressed a preference for other matters over your background to-dos. It gets real easy to populate your time with not-so-important tasks. Consider where you can say "no," and where you can _make time_ for things that matter most to you.
