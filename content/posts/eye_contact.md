In more individualist, less power-distant cultures, eye contact usually signals interpersonal connection. Of course, this depends on context and person; the spread based on context and person spans far wider than the distance between cultural averages.

That considered, eye contact holds surprisingly broad and deep power over people. 

During my freshman year, my upperclassman mentor gave me feedback that I made basically no eye contact in conversation. I started to make more eye contact while talking.

This year, I read _The Charisma Myth_ by Cabane. According to the text, charisma depends on presence, power, and warmth. Eye contact done correctly can boost all three.

As an exercise, Iâ€™ve been trying to hold eye contact with strangers for at least 3 seconds before shifting my gaze.[^1] Every single time the other person looks away before the 3 seconds pass. The exercise has really hammered home for me the rarity and power of eye contact. Now I try to make more eye contact while listening as well.
[^1]: Yes, I do feel a little psycho.
