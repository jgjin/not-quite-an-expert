1. ZABLAZZZKING

Our artist, anonymous perhaps to avoid the cops, has helpfully drawn a weed leaf. You can tell by the excessive enthusiasm that they have probably never actually smoked weed.

2. “The Daddy Special” 

Yes, I can tell this refers to some pizza topping combination. No, it did not help to exclaim “Daddy’s full”.

3. Za 피자 (Pizza)

The artist clarifies "피자 means pizza. It’s Korean." Hmph, very redundant. Almost like a young child with English as a second language. Almost.

4. Maggie 4th grade

Screw you, Maggie! I'll have you know I completed 5th grade! Nary a mention of pizza! I bet you got on the wall because of nepotism!

5. Za (pata)

The artist has drawn a portrait of Emiliano Zapata on a pizza, declaring on the side "¡Viva la revolución!" Damn, get 'em hooked on class warfare young, I suppose.

6. Anxious? Depressed? Try Za!!! Now!

God help this guy if he goes through an actual mental health issue.
