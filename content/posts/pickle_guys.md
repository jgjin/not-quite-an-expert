This week, I went to [the last standing pickle store on Essex Street](https://pickleguys.com/pages/about-us), The Pickle Guys. Upon entering the store, a crowd of barrels, then the eponymous Pickle Guys, greeted me.

The Pickle Guys don't just sell pickles; they embody an ideal, reminiscent of the [Village People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village_People) (who sing the familiar YMCA song). Various flavors gather together. The Asian one! The black one! And the one whose slight lisp suggests he likes pickles (not just the ones they sell in the store)!
