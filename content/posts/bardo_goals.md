I originally wanted to call them "limbo goals". However, "bardo", the period between death and rebirth, feels more precise.

I've died at Glean, and I've yet to rebirth at Ramp. In between, I have time to think about, and hopefully move toward, how I want to live.

In my final week at Glean, I asked many of my co-workers what they would do with a few weeks not needing to work. Travel, see friends, sure. Most interestingly, some emphasized the philosophical importance of doing nothing.

However, perhaps because of Glean, I find myself incapable of doing purely nothing. So I've written down some "bardo goals":
1. Take nice profile photos
2. Prototype a matcha machine
3. Dance!
4. Start running?
5. Write a self manual (for others)
6. Read!
