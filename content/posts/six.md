6 is a [✨perfect number✨](https://oeis.org/A000396), the sum of its (positive) proper divisors. 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

Any [Mersenne prime](https://oeis.org/A000043) _m_, when substituted into _m (m + 1) / 2_ will yield a ✨perfect number✨, as foretold by Euclid and Euler. The founder of geometry, and the founder of [so many things they had to start naming them after the second founder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_things_named_after_Leonhard_Euler), united after two millennia.

6, though, is special among ✨perfect numbers✨. It also equals the product of its proper divisors. 1 * 2 * 3 = 6. It divides evenly into halves and thirds.

Perhaps, in your salaciousness, you would like to divide evenly into fourths and fifths. Oh, what's that over there? It's 60 (a multiple of 
✨6✨, I must note, like every number that divides evenly into halves and thirds), the number of seconds in a minute and the number of minutes in an hour. The number of hours in a day, 24, also is a multiple of ✨6✨. 

"Ah," you might say, "365 days per year **isn't** a multiple of 6!" Well, 366 is a multiple, and everyone knows leap years are the only **real** years anyway. Non-leap years pour the milk first, leap years pour the cereal first.[^1]
[^1]: Lately, after getting splashed by milk, I've come around to pouring the milk before the cereal.

All around you live arbitrary values. How many should I buy? How many should I try? How many should I tie-dye?[^2] The next time you get to decide an arbitrary value, consider ✨6✨.
[^2]: Admittedly, I just wanted to rhyme. I haven't tie-dyed, _yet_.
