[I emerged from senior year into closed doors.]({{< ref "emerging_adulthood.md" >}}) Over the course of the global pandemic, I worked for Google as a Software Engineer. Two opposites stand out from this time: unwellness and resilience.

At first, I couldn't even refer to the COVID-19 pandemic by name: not "corona", instead a ["crown"]({{< ref "crown.md" >}}); the ["Inside Times"]({{< ref "i_we_you.md" >}}). Isolated, insulated, [I cried and thought of death]({{< ref "i_cried_annotations.md" >}}). Overwhelmed by It All (et al.), [I traveled to 7 cities in 7 weeks, and cried again]({{< ref "lady_bird.md" >}}). 

In reaction, I found surprising energy to explore the world and improve myself. Besides the "revenge travel" to 7 cities, for the first time in my life, I started to regularly exercise and read, habits which persist to this day. I also learned to separate my self from my job, and find other meaning in my life.

I arrived in San Francisco [with great excitement for the future]({{< ref "bay_baptism.md" >}}). I met my manager in-person for the first time over tea. Finally mustering the will, I asked if they would support my applying for promotion next cycle. They politely responded no.

My unwellness flared up. I looked back upon my work with stained lenses. Then my resilience kicked in, and I resolved to recruit for new roles.
