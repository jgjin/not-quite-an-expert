I had an espresso flight at Starbucks. At risk (at certainty) of sounding like yet another coffee snob, I didn't pick up any of the tasting notes. I only tasted "burnt". People suggest tasting notes; some people suggest badly, or for mere marketing.

In Paris,[^1] I dined at a wine bar. I watched as another patron sipped on a glass of wine, then brought home a bottle of it - the strong joy and sales tactic of trying before buying! I enjoy the same for coffee (beans roasted at a local coffee shop), and in rare cases, for tea!
[^1]: sounding like a real snob now!
