The edges of New York City resemble the suburban sprawl I grew up in. After getting a [New Haven style apizza](https://ny.eater.com/2023/7/31/23813347/lalas-brooklyn-apizza-williamsburg-review), I walked toward the Metropolitan Avenue Bridge, seeking water. Along the [stroad](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/10/30/the-stroad), the small specialty warehouses (refrigeration? truck repair? Thai food?) lifted my flickering awareness of long supply chains to the foreground.

Though we constructed these spaces for vehicles, not people, I ventured deeper until I encountered a perfect gate, with a chain lock to block intruders and a gap just big enough for me to squeeze through. And so I did, sliding my cold leftover apizza and warm gas station sparkling water beneath the gate to accompany me. Though the wholly rectangular waterway looked ugly, it felt beautiful, as if I had rebelled against suburbia.
