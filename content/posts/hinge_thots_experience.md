I finally created a dating app profile on Hinge! I had hesitated for so long because doing so requires confronting big questions like:
1. What do I even want?
2. How do I appear to others?
3. How do I compare to others?

Like [I learned from woodworking]({{< ref woodworking_trial >}}), at some point you just have to try, rather than theorize. Actual experience will provide some answers.
