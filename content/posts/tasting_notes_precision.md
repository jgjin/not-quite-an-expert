My coworker hosted a wine tasting with a group including me. For the first wine, we came up with specific notes like lychee and raspberry. Even though I wet the tip of my nose with the red wine, I couldn't smell both lychee _and_ raspberry, only lychee _or_ raspberry. The hosting coworker wrote down many notes for their sommelier class.

For the second wine, the hosting coworker remarked, to controversy and my surprise, that once you discern a _category_ of notes, you're just selecting an _instance_ for effect. For example, you discern stone fruit, so you could just select _fresh peaches_ or _baked apricots_ to evoke varying impressions.

Previously, my friend joked to me that "you'd come up with some obscure tasting note, like [passion fruit pulp]({{< ref "passionate_for_passion_fruit.md" >}}) or something". And I objected/declared "no, subtlety bends toward classism!"

Like good for you, you have a special nose, or more likely the money and time, to distinguish between _fresh peaches_ and _baked apricots_ before going nose blind. _Get bent._ I can't; I bet most people can't; I'm still trying to not wet the tip of my nose while huffing wine.
