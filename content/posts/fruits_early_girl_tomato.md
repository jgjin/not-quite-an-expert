I have eaten (or drunk) at over 300 restaurants in San Francisco, and soon the same in New York City.[^1] While NYC has more people so more variety at more times, SF has the freshness of California, which produces [over half of the fruits and vegetables in the US](https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/farm_bill).
[^1]: Say you don't cook without saying you don't cook!

The last 2 times I've visited SF, I've procured dry farmed early girl tomatoes to make a beautiful tomato sauce, based on [this simple recipe by Marcella Hazan](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015178-marcella-hazans-tomato-sauce).

[Rivaling heirloom tomatoes](https://web.archive.org/web/20080921131654/http://www.seasonalchef.com/marketreport082008.htm), the early girl hybrid tomato responds well to dry farming. [In dry farming, the plant, un-watered after transplanting, produces more concentrated flavor.](https://web.archive.org/web/20090703035852/http://nopasf.com/food/a_visit_to_dirty_girl)

Dry farmed early girl tomatoes have celebrity fans, from [Alice Waters of Chez Panisse fame](https://web.archive.org/web/20000310104625/http://www.seasonalchef.com/waters.htm) to [Tony Gemignani of Tony's Pizza Napoletana fame](https://tonygemignani.com/tony-gemignani-talks-secrets-to-great-tasting-tomato-sauce/). Therefore, I feel justified and just a little fancy in my dedication to these red gems. So much so that I ordered an Uber to drop off a jar of the sauce I made to my friend before I left SF.
