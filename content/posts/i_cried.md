I cried

Because my parents cried, the saddest I could remember, and I loved them so much</br>
Because my parents suffocated me, made me scared they wouldn't let me go

Because I couldn't go anywhere, the Virus locked me Inside</br>
Because I couldn't move on, to the next place, to the next stage

Because I feared death, coming mid-paragraph, putting an End</br>
Because I feared life, of how I would live and live on

Bleeding tears from wounds inflicted by others, by myself,</br>
I cried
