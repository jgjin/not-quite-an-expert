My order of 1 chicken rice bowl went wrong beyond my imagination!
1. They didn't have chicken, so substituted falafel
2. and they didn't have yellow rice, so substituted white rice
3. and they threw in a complimentary reparatory sweet, though I wanted to avoid sweets
4. and they added a giant pickle, though I dislike pickles
5. and they packed it in a bag, though I asked for no bag to avoid waste
6. and the rice tasted blander than rice
7. and the hummus tasted bitter
8. and I lightly choked on the falafel

Despite this ["fuck-ass"]({{< ref "inappropriate_linorobot.md" >}}) rice bowl, I still left a 15% tip - the service staff didn't do anything wrong, or at least they didn't do anything malicious. Then I left just a little mad.
