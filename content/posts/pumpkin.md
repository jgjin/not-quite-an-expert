# Week 1
I'm staying at a friend's place. I bought a smol orange pumpkin for decoration. I plop it onto their bedside table.

J: Did you buy a pumpkin? 

not quite an expert: What do you mean?

J: The pumpkin beside my bed.

not quite an expert: Where did you get that pumpkin?

J: ðŸ¤¨

not quite an expert: ðŸ™‚
# Week 2
I bought a smol white pumpkin. I replace the smol orange pumpkin, hiding it in my bag.

J: Did the pumpkin change color?

not quite an expert: What do you mean?

J: The white pumpkin beside my bed.

not quite an expert: What? Did you scare the color out of the pumpkin?

J: ðŸ¤¨

not quite an expert: ðŸ™ƒ
# Week 3 
I switch the pumpkins.

J: You switched the pumpkins again, didn't you?

not quite an expert: What color pumpkin do we have now?

J: Orange

not quite an expert: What a miracle! Orange you glad?

J: ðŸ¤¨

not quite an expert: ðŸŽƒ
# Week 4
