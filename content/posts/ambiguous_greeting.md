I often deliberately greet people ambiguously: "What've you been up to?"

The ambiguity lets the other person direct the conversation toward what interests them. It also gives them an out: "Not much".

Furthermore, the ambiguity gauges their levels of attention: "At work or outside of work?" Though different people want to share more or less about certain aspects of themselves, I try to create substantial space: "Both, either".
