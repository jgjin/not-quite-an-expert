On top of [taste, smell, and touch]({{< ref "senses_of_flavor.md" >}}), memories and associations can influence of experience of flavor. This helps explain why some people have nostalgia or affection for flavors born out of compromise.

As I learned when I visited [Driftaway Coffee](https://driftaway.coffee), in the times of the British Raj, during the months of transport by sea from India to Europe, coffee absorbed the moisture and developed a musty flavor. When modern transportation reduced the time and humidity of transport, producers deliberately re-created those conditions, and thereby the musty flavor, along the Malabar coast of India during the monsoon months. And now we have Monsooned Malabar.

[Genmaicha originates from poorer Japanese people cheaply extending their tea with roasted rice](https://kettl.co/blogs/kettl-tea-blog/complete-guide-to-genmaicha), and [similarly chicory extended the limited supply of coffee in the American South during the Civil War](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/chicory-coffee-mix-new-orleans-made-own-comes-180949950). Now people seek out genmaicha and chicory coffee, even if they can afford plain tea and coffee.
