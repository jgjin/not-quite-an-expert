At [Saru Sushi Bar](https://akaisarusf.square.site/), you can order the "Hon Wasabi". Demonstrating that ["food and menus are uniquely challenging to translate"](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/why-bad-menu-translations-fails), I find this translation both incompetent and functional.

If "Hon" just means "True", you could just call it "True Wasabi". It reminds me of ["Just according to keikaku. (Translator's note: keikaku means plan)](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/just-according-to-keikaku)

However, if you want to communicate that this "Hon Wasabi" won't taste like other "wasabi" your customers have had before. And you don't want to explain that ["wasabi" in the US probably contains just horseradish powder and food dye](https://www.epicurious.com/ingredients/wasabi-vs-horseradish-the-difference-how-to-buy-and-store-article), calling it "Hon Wasabi" does the trick!

I wonder if the menu writers intended that.
