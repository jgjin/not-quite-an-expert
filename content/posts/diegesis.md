# Introduction
Look at the big word in the title!
# What is diegesis?
First, the elephant in the room: what does it mean?

For the non-critics in the audience, diegesis refers to details _within the universe of the story_. This is in contrast to details within our universe.

For example, suppose you are reading _Things Fall Apart_. The character Okonkwo's exile is _diegetic_; it happens within the story. On the other hand, the novel's first publication year of 1958 is _non-diegetic_; it happens outside the story.

Note diegesis applies broadly to textual art as a whole. By textual art I mean art that presents many details in order (not necessarily chronological order): books, plays, TV shows, movies, video games, to name a few. Diegesis applies less to visual art like fashion.
# Diegetic justification
When we look at textual art, we often feel an urge to interpret or justify events diegetically. Let's take a silly example.

Suppose we read a story in which the main character is revealed to have a **SEVERE PHOBIA** of fruits. Toward the end of the story, the main character gets hit with a banana and **FREAKS OUT**, like, just **LOSES THEIR MIND**.

An easy, and diegetic, way to interpret this scene is:
> _Oh, this makes sense. They were revealed to have a **SEVERE PHOBIA** of fruits._

Yet, on a non-diegetic level, we have to remember 2 things:
1. Someone, the author, editor, director, etc., chose to have the main character suffer this **SEVERE PHOBIA**.
2. Someone, likely that same someone, also chose to portray that **SEVERE PHOBIA** this way.

Let's say the author made this decision. The author could have chosen to give the main character an entirely different phobia. The author could have also chosen to never make the phobia relevant in the story ([which would make Chekhov unhappy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun)). The author could even have chosen to activate the main character's **SEVERE PHOBIA** in a different way, perhaps passing a stray pineapple on the street.

That the main character has this **SEVERE PHOBIA** at all, and that it was used in this way and described in this way, all were choices made during the writing process. Perhaps the author thought it would be funny. Alternatively, perhaps the author wanted to protest [the banana republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_republic) of the 20th century in an absurd way. Whatever the reason, the point is that diegesis is a deliberate _choice_, and that choice has meaning.
# Extreme art
In a much more serious case, consider viscerally or politically extreme art. Let's say you are watching a movie on [the Rwandan genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide).[^1] You watch as a radical Hutu slaughters Tutsi and moderate Hutu people. You _can't_, or at least _shouldn't_ just think:
[^1]: Diegetic/non-diegetic analysis applies even if the movie is non-fiction. For instance, the creator of a documentary must make content and presentation choices.
> _Oh, this makes sense. This is historically accurate._

Once again, someone made an integrated set of choices to portray _this_ in _this way_. That means _something_, and you should be thinking about that.

As a related point, suppose some art contains scenes that may trigger traumatic memories in a large portion of the potential audience. It is _not enough_ to simple say:
> _That's what happens in the story, so it should be included._

You have to be aware that the creators had to make choice of significant and probably knowable consequence. Not every choice creators make will be a good one.
# Conclusion
Art has meaning outside what happens in the story.
