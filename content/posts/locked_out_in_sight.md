Did you know my apartment building's clubhouse doors auto-lock around midnight? I learned that after coming back from the restroom, tugging, _pulling_, **YANKING** at all doors till my hands and arms became sore.

I could ***SEE*** my backpack and laptop. And while staring at them ***INDIGNANTLY***, I put them in lost mode. Then I went to sleep, trying to forget about it.

I forced myself to wake up early the next morning. And after waving to the janitor, I, relieved, retrieved my stuff.
