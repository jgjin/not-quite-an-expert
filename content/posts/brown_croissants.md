Do you know the story of croissants? [One story goes:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croissant)
> \[A\] baker of the 17th century, working through the night at a time when his city (either Vienna in 1683 or Budapest in 1686) was under siege by the Turks, heard faint underground rumbling sounds which, on investigation, proved to be caused by a Turkish attempt to invade the city by tunneling under the walls. The tunnel was blown up. The baker asked no reward other than the exclusive right to bake crescent-shaped pastries commemorating the incident, the crescent being the symbol of Islam.

You literally eat the symbol of Islam, take that! However, [this back story is likely apocryphal.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/t-magazine/food/croissant-hybrid-cronut-frankenpastries.html)

The stories we tell about food tell us about the people who eat the food. In this case, it tells us part of European identity positions itself against brown people. This should come at no surprise.

How weird (perhaps ironic?) then, [that brown people regularly comprise the winners of croissant competitions.](https://www.sortiraparis.com/en/news/in-paris/articles/275647-paris-where-is-the-best-butter-croissant-here-is-the-2023-list-of-winners) Baking takes hard work for not much money, and brown immigrants in France often do that hard work for not much money.
