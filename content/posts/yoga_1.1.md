Recently, as a [mindful mommy]({{< ref "mindful_mommy.md" >}}), I've been going on my 30-day Yoga Journey, a free yoga video series on YouTube. Those who remember I used to listen to music [at 1.4x speed]({{< ref "music_speed.md" >}}) will suspect I don't follow along at regular speed. Indeed, I'm sprinting along the path of my journey at 1.1x speed.

Yes, at first it felt almost sacrilegious to me too. I want you to cast aside your initial judgement, though, and re-consider the arguments I presented in [my post about music at 1.4x speed]({{< ref "music_speed.md" >}}). As consumers of media, we have the power of interpretation - to reproduce the media in our own way. That includes on a TV or on a phone, in a quiet apartment or in a noisy bar, and yes, at a slower or at a faster speed than 1.0x.

Given the variety of people out there, I have to imagine the "best" speed for everyone does not lie at exactly 1.0x.[^1] I have found casually (though not blindly) A/B testing between 1.0x and 1.1x speed that I prefer 1.1x.
[^1]: Famously, people can speak and listen at different paces. So you could image the optimal speed of production and consumption deviate.

Perhaps the most reasonable objection, people think of yoga as slowing down. However, since I usually watch YouTube videos at 2.0x speed, sometimes 1.5x, I am actually slowing down for my Yoga Journey!
