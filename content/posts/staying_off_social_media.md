Though I've only seen light evidence that it undermines [epistemics](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/11/scapegoating-the-algorithm) and [mental health](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-anxious-generation/id1651876897?i=1000664706439), I think social media moves faster than research and policy. I deliberately stay off social media: I don't have an X (previously Twitter), Instagram, or TikTok account, and I don't have the YouTube app on my phone.

I don't see myself as a better person than other people because of this (as my friend accused). However, I do see myself as better than the counterfactual version of myself on social media. I remember my time on Facebook (before I deleted that account) as mostly rotting, similar to [this description](https://helenaaeberli.substack.com/p/phone-noise), and I can't really point to anything meaningful I got out of it.
