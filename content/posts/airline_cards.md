Even with [all that price discrimination]({{< ref "airline_skiplagged.md" >}}), airlines don't make most of their money from fares. [Instead, they make more money on their credit cards.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/08/business/frequent-flyer-programs-airlines/index.html)

When you spend on those cards to earn miles, airlines earn a small percentage of that transaction. Airlines depend on credit card revenues so much that [they've adjusted their fares and rewards (miles) programs to optimize for it](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/09/airlines-banks-mileage-programs/675374).
