To measure ingredients for [this Barista Hustle recipe](https://www.baristahustle.com/diy-water-recipes-redux), I needed a scale with 0.01g precision.

Through this [Ultimate Guide to Milligram Scales](https://chemical-collective.com/blog/2023/02/15/the-ultimate-guide-to-milligram-scales-why-theyre-important-and-how-to-use-them), I found the AWS[^1] Gemini-20. One helpful Redditor even validated the accuracy of the AWS Gemini-20, [in r/drugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/14cku3/aws_gemini20_calibration_resultsreview)!

When I brought [my 3-inch mini spoon](https://www.crateandbarrel.com/caesna-mirror-mustard-spoon/s536741) for measuring additives (baking soda \[sodium bicarbonate\] and epsom salts \[magnesium sulfate\]), my coworker called it a "coke spoon". I really started to feel like a druggie for coffee water.
