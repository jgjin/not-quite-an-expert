During [my visit to Mountain View]({{< ref "ship_of_mtv.md" >}}), I stumbled upon a satellite building. In it, I found

the chill of abandoned space:

chairs and chairs and chairs:

boxes in boxes in boxes:

and a handicap door button _out of belonging_:
![button](/button.jpg)

This button belongs on the wall, not the floor! Seeing it out of its normal context provoked the question of belonging within me. _Do I find myself out of belonging?_

Perhaps more kindly, like a traveler lingering aimlessly in the limbo of an airport lounge, we can see the button as _in between belongings_. In that way, I've never related to a button so hard.
