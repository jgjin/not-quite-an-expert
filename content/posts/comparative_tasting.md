People generally have better relative judgement than absolute judgement.

For example, I could confidently tell you one island looks farther than the other, though could not confidently tell you the distance between any of the islands and me.

In fine beverages ([coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-iNAyu-ejo), tea, wine, etc.), you can use your relative judgement in comparative tasting to highlight tasting notes. For instance, this coffee tastes more fruity than the other; this tea tastes sweeter than the other.

You can even extend "comparative tasting" beyond food and drink, to figure out differentiating characteristics: this prose reads more clearly than the other; this key switch sounds more obnoxious than the other; this essential oil smells more floral than the other.

While I wouldn't always recommend it, you could "comparatively taste" people too.
