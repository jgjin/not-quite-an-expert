You know those mattress-in-a-box companies like [Casper](https://casper.com) or [Purple](https://purple.com) that ship mattresses directly to consumers? Taking advantage of their generous return policies, I ordered 3 mattresses in boxes my senior year, just after winter break.

Each of these mattresses they sent compressed in a giant plastic bag, so suddenly I had a gigantic pile of plastic. Rather than try to recycle the plastic, I kept it beside my bed, to ... I don't know ... admire.

When my friend U came over, a _fantastic_ idea dawned upon me: what if we wrapped U in one of these giant plastic bags, like a human taquito? We got to work like a pack of chaotic children.

As I was taking a _fashion_ photo shoot of this peak of _fashion_, the door burst open. My roommate had returned from winter break, and I had no good explanation.
